	<blockquote>"The bad boys of the internet, now available in print format!  This is not about getting some hacking tips for kitties but the tales of the cDc by the cDc since 1984. This is the cDc bible. A must.."</blockquote>

	<blockquote>"Personally I feel more enlightened with having hardcopies of two of those books [<em>Commodork</em> and <em>The Book of Cao</em>] than pdf'ing it. The basic content of the book of cao is already available as internet text free of charge, it's only put into a divine system and presented on cellulose fibers with ink and that is why it costs moolah."</blockquote>

09-17-2006 - Caball&eacute;, Xavi, "<a href="http://www.caballe.cat/2006/09/17.html#a7812">Llibre: &laquo;The Book of Cao. Enlightenment throught a Poke in the Eye&raquo;</a>."
	<blockquote><em>Original (in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catalan_language">Catalan</a>)</em>:  "Culf of the Dead Cow, cDc pels amics, &eacute;s un nom m&iacute;tic dins de la hist&ograve;ria del hacktivisme. De fet en s&oacute;n els creadors del moviment que lluita contra les diferents forma de censura i limitaci&oacute; dels drets humans utilitzant la tecnologia.<br />

<br />
cDc va ser fundat l'any 1984 a Texas, entre altres coses han iniciat les Hacker con, les HoHoCon; van originar el newsgroup alt.fan.cult-dead-cow, el primer grupo de news d'un grup de hackers. Tamb&eacute; va declarar la guerra a l'esgl&eacute;sia de la cienciologia i l'any 1997 van ser la primera web en distribuir m&uacute;sica en format MP3.<br />
<br />
El llibre "The Book of Cao", subitulat Enlightenment throught a Poke in the Eye &eacute;s una col&#8226;lecci&oacute; retrospectiva dels diversos documents que ha generat el grup des de la seva fundaci&oacute;. &Eacute;s tant per tant una oportunitat &uacute;nica de trobar-nos amb la hist&ograve;ria viva d'Internet i con&egrave;ixer l'evoluci&oacute; del moviment que ha centrat la seva ra&oacute; de ser en la protecci&oacute; de la llibertat dels usuaris dins de la xarxa."</blockquote>

	<blockquote><em>English Translation (per <a href="http://www.transendium.com/">Transendium</a>)</em>:  "Culf of the Dead Cow, cDc for the friends, is a mythical name in the history of the hacktivisme. As a matter of fact the creators of the movement that fight against the different ones forms are from censorship and limitation of the human rights using the technology.<br />
<br />
cDc was set up in the year 1984 in Texas, among other things have pioneered the cone Hacker, the HoHoCon; they originated the newsgroup alt.fan.cult-dead-cow, the first grupo of news of a group of hackers. Also it stated the war to the church of the cienciologia and in year 1997 they were the first web page on distributing music in format MP3.<br />
<br />
The book "The Book of Cao", subitulat Enlightenment throught in Poke in the Eye is a retrospective collection of the several documents that the group has generated from its foundation. It is so much therefore an only opportunity to feel the living history of Internet and to know the evolution of the movement that has centered its reason for being in the protection of the freedom of the users in the net."</blockquote>

	<blockquote>"Paris Hilton an Honorary Member!<br />

Thanks for sharing with the world what drives The Cult of The Dead Cow. The Book of Cao is now one of my favoutite books."</blockquote>

09-13-2006 - Hinge, Mark, "Review: <em>The Book Of Cao</em>," Whitedust Security Portal.
	<blockquote>"Lets start this review by saying that not only am I a big supporter of cDc I am also a big fan of the text file scene in general and have indeed played a part in said scene for many years. Can you say; target demographic?<br />
<br />
That aside and moving on to just the most important fact about this fine publication; this book is funny. And not just for 'geeks' and 'hackers', the humour is universal. Silly at times yes, but universal never the less. The day it arrived I was working onsite with a client who picked the book from my things and flicked through it. To my surprise he laughed a lot and didn't fire me, despite having no idea who or what cDc are or indeed what most of the book was about, it still got the chuckle.<br />
<br />
...<br />

<br />
The files themselves are compiled from numerous sources and written by numerous authors spanning many years. For anyone not familiar with the style of cDc text files: anarchic, obscure and quite, quite mad seems to sum them up best.<br />
<br />
What's good about this book? Put simply; internet counter culture at it's [sic] best.<br />
<br />
What's bad about this book? The fact it's not longer. If you read it and like it you could be reading it all day; it draws you in and that's a let down when you reach page 150 only to find the Cao has abandoned you.<br />
<br />
Who would be interested in buying this book? Anyone interested in internet counter culure; hacking and the so called digital 'underground' - and anyone who is a already a fan of the text file scene.<br />
<br />
Whitedust hope to see more print publications from cDc communications in the near future."<br /></blockquote>

	<blockquote>"Infamous hacking organization "Cult of the Dead Cow" has just released a new book, explaining their philosophy and arguing why you should believe in it too. Definitely worth checking out."</blockquote>

08-28-2006 - Jones, Punkle, "<a href="http://punkle.livejournal.com/89671.html">The Book of Cao: Enlightenment through a Poke in the Eye</a>."
	<blockquote>"The selection of t-files that are compiled in this publication are all related to the spiritual mythos of the Cult of the Dead Cow...an inspiring collection of text. Perfect for carrying in your back pocket to conventions, 2600 meetings, church. The group hasn't decided to "cross over" into print media after 20 years of online publication - rather it sought to publish a pocket-sized collection you can keep on you...and maybe it looks a little bit the little red Book of Mao. Except better, and filled with essential SeXXXee vitamins and minerals!"</blockquote>
