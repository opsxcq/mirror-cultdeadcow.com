CULT OF THE DEAD COW (cDc) Unveils <i>The Book of Cao</i><br />
<br />
Collection of spiritual text files intended to enlighten the unwashed masses.<br />
<br />
New York, NY (PRWEB) August 28, 2006 &mdash; CULT OF THE DEAD COW (cDc), a prominent group of technology activists and inspiring thought leaders, has just released its first book, entitled <i>The Book of Cao: Enlightenment through a Poke in the Eye</i>.<br />
<br />
<i>The Book of Cao</i> is a collection of cDc text files, designed to relate the group's spiritual beliefs. Available for the notable price of $13.37, this book is perfect for daily devotional study and global evangelizing. It can be purchased online at <a href="http://www.lulu.com/content/381240">http://www.lulu.com/content/381240</a>. Proceeds from all book sales will be used to sponsor cDc missionaries deployed around the world.<br />

<br />
"This book is chock full of life-changing genius," says avid cDc text file reader RaD Man, founder of ACiD Productions (<a href="http://www.acid.org">http://www.acid.org</a>). "cDc publishing a book of its spiritual beliefs is the next logical step in its mission to subvert the world's populace through sheer ass-kickery."<br />
<br />
While this book marks its first foray into the world of print media, the cDc is no stranger to publishing. For the last two decades, it has released a stream of riveting text files (<a href="../../cms/textfile_index.php3">http://www.cultdeadcow.com/cms/textfile_index.php3</a>), brilliantly addressing various cultural and technology topics. However, the spiritual aspect of the cDc's work has been somewhat overlooked. Until now...<br />
