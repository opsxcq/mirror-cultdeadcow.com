Computer Hacking New Tool of Political Activism By Naomi KleinFrom The Toronto Star, July 23, 1998Imagine if computer hackers, the daredevils of the networked world,suddenly became principled political activists.Imagine if they had a mission besides breaking and entering; if theyhad more to prove than that they are smarter than whoever designed yourcomputer system. Imagine if their targets were selected as part of wellorganized, thoroughly researched, international human rights campaigns.        In truth, "really good hackers use their skills like a chess game,"explains Oxblood Ruffin, the name used by the Foreign Minister of theCult of the Dead Cow, one of the oldest and most infamous hackercabals. Most hackers aren't out to destroy, just to gain access and saythey did.       When they slide into a supposedly secure network, its checkmate time.The invaded institution then has two choices: call the police or offerthe kid a job. "Good hackers", Ruffin says, "are the richest21-year-olds I know."   But Ruffin is among a growing group of outlaw programmers determined tomake hacking more than job interviewing as an extreme sport. They arebeginning to experiment with the mind-blowing skill locked in theglobal network of hackers as a powerful political tool for what Ruffincalls "human rights hacking."        Over the past few months, there has been an upsurge in political hacks,the highest profile of which was pulled off by a group of teenagersfrom England and New Zealand in June. Protesting the nuclear tests,three teens broke into the computer system at India's Bhabba AtomicResearch Centre, downloaded top secret documents and replaced Websiteswith a site of their own: a mushroom cloud and an anti-war message.        The real message was the fact of the hack: if the weapons system isn'tsafe from a bunch of meddling teens, how can these so-called securityexperts be expected to prevent disaster when an actual enemy is afterthem?   A less invasive approach to political hacking is the "virtual sit-in,"a technique developed by New York-based supporters of the Zapatistas'struggle against the Mexican government. At a designated date and timeeach month, the group has tried to overload key Mexican and AmericanWebsites by flooding them with simultaneous hits from cyberprotesters.All of this is relatively benign, however, compared to what is in storefrom the Hong Kong Blondes. The Blondes are the hacker wing of China'spro-democracy movement, scattered around the world and forcedunderground after Tiananmen. On July 7, days after Bill Clintonreturned from his trip to China, Blondie Wong, the pseudonymousdirector of the Blondes, met with Ruffin and the two went public with anew level in political hacking: the Yellow Pages.In their conversation, a rare public communication from the Blondes,Wong says the U.S. foreign relations agenda with Beijing has beenhijacked by corporations wanting access to the Chinese market. "Beijingsuccessfully went around Congress and straight to American business, soin effect, businessmen started dictating foreign policy," he says.What they have dictated is a situation where trade is so open, there isno longer any incentive left for the Chinese government to reform. Ifchange is to come, Wong reasons, pro-democracy activists must targettheir actions at the multinationals pulling the political strings. "Bytaking the side of profit over conscience, business has set ourstruggle back so far that they have become our oppressors too."        The implications of this are profound. The Blondes are highly skilledcomputer scientists and astrophysicists who have already claimedresponsibility for shutting down a Chinese government communicationssatellite. They have operatives around the world, including, accordingto Wong, several members inside the Communist party.Now they are tapping into the wider hacker community. The Yellow Pagesare a group based in California which formed to support the Blondes'political goals by targeting the computer systems of multinationals inChina.  "Human rights is an international issue, so I don't have a problem withbusinesses that profit from our suffering paying part of the bill.Perhaps they will see the wisdom of putting some conditions on trade,"Wong says.      And here's the kicker: Blondie Wong lives in Toronto. Ruffin seems tospend quite a bit of time here, too. Marshall McLuhan wrote that "WorldWar III would be a guerilla information war with no division betweencivilian and military participation."Wouldn't he be proud to know that the first salvos were being firedfrom his home town?
