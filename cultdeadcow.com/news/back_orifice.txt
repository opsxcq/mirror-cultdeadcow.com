OUR CONDOLENCES.[July 21, San Francisco] The CULT OF THE DEAD COW (cDc) will release BackOrifice, a remote MS Windows Administration tool at Defcon VI in Las Vegas(www.defcon.org) on August 1. Programmed by Sir Dystic [cDc], Back Orificeis a self-contained, self-installing utility which allows the user tocontrol and monitor computers running the Windows operating system over anetwork.Sir Dystic sounded like an overworked sysadmin when he said, "The two mainlegitimate purposes for BO are, remote tech support aid and employeemonitoring and administering [of a Windows network]."Back Orifice is going to be made available to anyone who takes the time todownload it. So what does that mean for anyone who's bought intoMicrosoft's Swiss cheese approach to security? Plenty according toMike Bloom, Chief Technical Officer for Gomi Media in Toronto."The current path of learning I see around me is to learn what you have toto cover your ass, go home and watch Jerry. Microsoft has capitalized onthis at the cost of production value which translates down to security. Amove like releasing [Back Orifice] means that the lowest commondenominator of user will have to come to understand the threat, and thatit is not from [Sir Dystic] writing an app that [potentially] turns Win32security on its ear, but that Microsoft has leveraged itself into aposition where anyone who wants to can download an app [or write theirown!] and learn a few tricks and make serious shit happen."None of this is lost on Microsoft. But then again, they don't care.Security is way down on their list of priorities.  But regardless of  which side of the firewall you sit on, you can't afford not to have acopy of Back Orifice. Here are the specs:Back Orifice (BO) allows the user to remotely control almost all parts ofthe operating system, including:       File system     Registry     System     Passwords     Network     Processes* BO contains extensive multimedia control, allowing images to be capturedfrom the server machine's screen, or from any video input device attachedto the machine.* BO has an integrated HTTP server, allowing uploads and downloads offiles to and from a machine on any port using any http client.* BO has an integrated packet sniffer, allowing easy monitoring of networktraffic.* BO has an integrated keyboard monitor, allowing the easy logging ofkeystrokes to a log file.* BO allows connection redirection, allowing connections to be bounced offa machine to any other machine on the Internet.* BO allows application redirection, allowing text based applicationsrunning on the server machine to be controlled via a simple telnetsession.  Even open a remote shell.* BO has a simple plugin interface, allowing additional modules to bewritten by third parties, and executed in Back Orifice's hidden systemprocess.* BO is EASY TO INSTALL!  Simply run the server, and it installs itself,and removes the executable it was originally run from, or it can beattached to any other Windows executable, which will run normally afterinstalling the Back Orifice server.* BO is TRANSPARENT!  Back Orifice does not show up in the task list, oreven the Close Programs dialog, it is automatically restarted each timethe computer boots, and does not affect the operation of any otherapplications.* BO is CONFIGURABLE!  The filename that Back Orifice installs itself as,the port Back Orifice communicates on, and the encryption key are allconfigurable before the server is installed.* BO is ENCRYPTED!  Communication packets used by Back Orifice areencrypted with a user definable key, so only the intended client cancontrol the server.* BO is FREE!  All the functionality mentioned above AND MORE is availablein the 120k server, along with an easy to use text based or GUI client,Back Orifice comes with everything you need to distribute and control anynumber of machines.* BO is GROWING!  New features, increased efficiency, new plugins, andmore support are being added to Back Orifice every day.After August 3, Back Orifice will be available from www.cultdeadcow.comfree of charge.For further details or lucrative film offers, please contact:The Deth VegetableMinister of PropagandaCULT OF THE DEAD COWveggie@cultdeadcow.com............................................................................The CULT OF THE DEAD COW (cDc) is the most influential group of hackers inthe world.
