The group provided Wired News with an advance copy of the interview. <p>In the interview, Wong seemed unconcerned about any damage or monetary losses that might result from a network attack carried out by the Yellow Pages. <p>"Human rights is an international issue, so I don't have a problem with businesses that profit from our suffering paying part of the bill," he told Oxblood.<p>As leader of the Hong Kong Blondes hacking group, Wong has the credentials to back up his threats. With members operating inside and outside of China, the Hong Kong Blondes claim to have found significant security holes within Chinese government computer networks, particularly systems related to satellite communications.<p>The group claims it first announced itself to the government in Beijing last year by temporarily disabling a Chinese communications satellite -- an incident never confirmed by the Chinese government.<p>Since then, the group has threatened to cripple certain Chinese military and security networks if human rights issues in China reach what they decide is a critical point.<p>Members of the Cult of the Dead Cow said that the organization began advising the Blondes on strong encryption and network intrusion at the annual "Beyond Hope" hacker conference held in New York last August. <p>In the interview, Wong details how he saw his father stoned to death by members of the Chinese Red Guard during the Cultural Revolution, the period of political chaos that engulfed China during the 1960s and '70s.<p>Later, as a student attending an unspecified university in the Great Britain where he was studying to become a teacher, Wong describes watching televised images of the 1989 massacre at Tiananmen Square.<p>"When the tanks went into the square and began shooting and running over people, it was like I was a little boy again, watching my father being killed," he told Oxblood. <p>Wong claimed that the Hong Kong Blondes has doubled in size, with 42 active members operating in China and other countries. Many of the group's newest members are Chinese government employees, whom Wong describes as "technical people." <p>One member, a female hacker known as Lemon Li, was detained earlier this year and has since been moved to Paris with the help of a group Blondie described only as "a group of people even more outside the law than we are." The same group provides Wong with an armed escort wherever he goes. <p>The interviewer, Oxblood, said he knows little about the origin or membership of the Yellow Pages, other than that the organization was founded recently by students at Cal Tech.<p>"Blondie wants anyone who agrees with the strategy of attacking American companies doing business in China to get involved," Oxblood said. "So starting new chapters is really up to whoever gets inspired, making membership open to anyone." <p>Sun Microsystems, Lucent, Motorola, Yahoo, and Excite are among a growing number of American companies active in China.<p>As for any current or future activities of the Hong Kong Blondes, Oxblood said the group has been patiently watching and waiting.<p>"They have gotten to the point where they can pretty much hack everything that is up and running. [Wong] is pretty tight-lipped about what he's got planned. I would say though, that the Blondes have the capacity to snap the backbone of the Chinese end of the Net."<br><br><font face= "geneva, arial" size=2><b><i>Related Wired Links:</i></b></font> <br><img src="pix.gif" height=1 width=292><br><br><font face="helvetica, Arial" size=2><b> <a href="http://www.wired.com/news/news/culture/story/13671.html"> China's Internet Explosion </a></b></font> <br><font face="geneva, Arial" size=1 color=#FF0000>13.Jul.98</font><br><br><font face="helvetica, Arial" size=2><b> <a href="http://www.wired.com/news/news/politics/story/13349.html"> US Urges China Net Freedom</a></b></font> <br><font face="geneva, Arial" size=1 color=#FF0000>30.Jun.98</font><br><br><font face="helvetica, Arial" size=2><b> <a href="http://www.wired.com/news/news/business/story/13192.html"> US Firms Ink Big China Pacts </a></b></font> <br><font face="geneva, Arial" size=1 color=#FF0000>23.Jun.98</font><br><br><font face="helvetica, Arial" size=2><b> <a href="http://www.wired.com/news/news/business/story/12665.html"> Excite Follows Yahoo into China</a></b></font> <br><font face="geneva, Arial" size=1 color=#FF0000>2.Jun.98</font><br><br></font> <!-- END_OF_BODY --><br><br><!-- start of newsbot query --><!-- generic newsbot text --></b><font face="geneva, arial" size=2><i>Check on other Web coverage of this story with <a href=http://www.hotwired.com/cgi-bin/redirect/10018/http://www.wired.com/news/wirednewsbot.html><b>NewsBot</b></a></i></font><!-- end generic newsbot text --><!-- end of newsbot query -->   <br><br></td></tr><tr><td align=right valign=top colspan=1 width=30>                    <a href="http://www.cultdeadcow.com/news/news/top_stories/"><img border=0 src="x.gif" width=30 height=15 border=0 alt="[Back]"></a> </td><td><img border=0 src="navstrip_politics.gif" USEMAP="#navstrip.map" alt="[Navigation strip]" height=17 width=126><br><br><font face="geneva, arial" size=2><a href="http://www.cultdeadcow.com/news/rantrave.html">Rants & Raves</a>: Send your rants and raves to Wired News.<p><a href="mailto:tips@wired.com">Tips</a>: Have a story or tip for Wired News?
