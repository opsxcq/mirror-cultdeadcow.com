Weoperate in the bitter darkness outside the known channels. We thrivein the ferro-concrete walls of the technological civilization. We arethe stainless steel rats, gnawing at the underpinnings of the'Information Superhighway', spreading the power and propaganda of theCow wherever we go.</TT></P><P><TT>Founded in late 1984, the Cult of the Dead Cow (cDc) is theoldest group still active in the computer underground; the only group(aside from a few layme p1RaT3 gR0oPzZz) with a female group member;the only group to host its own annual HoHoCon hacker convention; and,with over 300 text files in circulation, the most prolific group. cDcis definitely cooler than the Legion of Doom (LoD), and moreimportantly, our T-shirts are more colorful. We also havestickers.</TT></P><P><TT>Great, you may say, but have we ever disrupted communicationson two continents by moving telecommunications satellites? Mhm.Hacked computing resources belonging to the three-letter agencies andthe Pentagon? Yep. Electronically altered environmental controls inlocal malls? Done that. But unlike other hacker groups you'veundoubtedly read about, we've never been caught.</TT></P><P><TT>With qualifications like these, it's not surprising that overthe past few years, the media has looked to us as the darling boy(and girl) torch-bearers of the DIY-cyber-hacker-undergroundmovement. It's our unfortunate cross to bear. But as the whole ofGeneration X follows our lead into the new millenium, we feel it isour duty to our peers to maintain the struggle and "raise high ourfreak flag," as it were.</TT></P><P><TT>On their behalf, we intend to dominate and subvert the mediawherever possible. Information is a virus. And we intend to infectall of you.</TT></P><BLOCKQUOTE><CENTER><TT>There is NO vaccine.<BR>   There is NO escape.<BR>   There is NO hope.<BR>   There is ONLY cDc.<BR>   </TT></CENTER></BLOCKQUOTE><P><TT>What follows is the unabridged update on our progress to taintyour global information outlets.

Regardless of whether             you'll be taking a ride in Kelly's cab anytime soon,             there's plenty of reason to pick up his zine -- the             current issue features rambling interviews with local             bands Henry's Dress, Snowmen and Fuck, an             ill-fated chat with testy S.F.

Interspersed are some             hair-raising stories from San Francisco cabbies, and the             whole affair comes with a 7-inch compilation             featuring the bands reviewed within.     57.

BIZARRE is a British             magazine and we suspect that they are none too             savvy about URL naming conventions (they listed the             domain name wrong, for one thing), else they might             have realized that Mr.T (Peace be upon him!) has nothing             to do with the site, save to be an object of veneration             and adoration.     53.

'Now, it is basically a point and click             world. If you can run Windows  95, you can be a hacker.'"             This is patently ridiculous.  Although if it were true,             the Air Force has just issued a damning testimonial             of their own security.  Maybe they're running NT?  See             item #54 above.     41. Mudge is pictured in the August, 1996 issue of             _Wired_ (pg 40), holding court in the L0pht:             "What do a group of hackers do when the equipment they've             accumulated over years of dumpster diving no longer fits             in their apartments?  They get a L0pht.  Since 1993, a core             group of seven Boston-based hackers have rented a loft             space for hacking, trading information about cellular             phone security, and building things like a wireless             Internet service using discarded microwave equipment.  All             strictly for educational purposes, of course. ... why do             they keep at it?  'For the girls and the text files, of             course,' says Mudge."     40.

The Cult of the Dead Cow's first annual Won Ton Con was held            in Toronto, Canada on the 26th and 27th of October, 1996.            Telecom's uber-elite swarmed to the city like a plague of            locusts to swap war stories, trade hacks and be debriefed            on the Hong Kong Blondes &#91;1&#93;. Cult of the Dead Cow Minister            of Propaganda - The Deth Vegetable - was interviewed at            Shift Magazine for a CBC episode of 'Futureworld' entitled             "Dangers to Personal Privacy".          &#91;1&#93; The Hong Kong Blondes are a group of Chinese computer             scientists and human rights activists using the Internet             against the Communist Government. The group is led by             Blondie Wong, a British educated scientist currently              residing in Toronto. The Hong Kong Blondes have units in              Hong Kong, Shanghai and Beijing. Under the aegis of the             Cult  of the Dead Cow they disrupt official information             systems in the People's Republic of China.      4. _Electronic Engineering Times_, August 26, 1996, pg. 62.             Defcon '96, and the many talented hackers there,             including, of course, cDc, which celebrated its twelfth             anniversary at the convention.

"cDc?  I'd have to vote them 'Most Likely to Pillage the            Global Village'."               -- Bruce Sterling      3. "I am like Ward Cleaver compared to cDc... 'June, those cDc boys            are outrageous, we shouldn't let the Beave play with them!@'"               -- SuperNigger of MoD      4. "cDc.  Punks with computers.  You've been warned."               -- R.U. Serius, Publisher of _Mondo 2000_      5. "The cDc is one of those groups, for true or not, whom one            feels has 'underworld connections.'  If you want hash, a            bail bondsman, a nude model, a hit man, a smuggler, a            Chinese hunchback dwarf, a system of ripping off AT&T, a hot            car, a kangaroo with a broken tail, a cure for rinderpest,             a fast loan, a mail drop for Justice Scalia,             a long-out-of-print bit of pornography, or a Corvette from             the mothball fleet... cDc is the group one contacts."               -- Harlan Ellison      6. "...it's pointless to compare LoD to the cDc... it's like            comparing Albert Einstein to Charles Manson... Both were            geniuses in their respective genre."               -- Erik Bloodaxe of LoD      7. "Next to the shriveled corpse of William S. Burroughs, cDc's            prose is the stuff of my sexual fantasies. Their collective            intelligence is potent and erotic."               -- Poppy Z. Brite      8. "Until I found the CULT OF THE DEAD COW, I was a high            school nobody! I couldn't get laid if my life depended on it!            Now, I'm humpin' all of my teachers!"               -- Weaselboy, Net-celebrity      9. "I can attest to the fact that cDc is the sexiest group of            computer hackers there ever was.  You may think this silly,            but it's the God's honest truth."               -- Jane Pratt, Editor-In-Chief, _Sassy Magazine_     10.

"Those cDc fuckers ran up my hotel phone bill while I was on tour!"               -- Rod Stewart     14. "I wish those CDC guys would spend less time writing textfiles,            and more time in the lab curing diseases!"               -- Emmanuel Goldstein, Editor, _2600_ magazine.     15. "If it's illegal, immoral or revolting, cDc has a file about            it -- and possibly three of them."               -- Michael Hoy, Loompanics Unlimited     16. "I am really, truly, deeply sorry I offended you. Honest. I did            not know how all-pervading and powerful you really were.            Now can I have my credit rating, e-mail and bank account            back, please?"               -- Neil Gaiman     17.
