There's also a notorious hacker who goesby the name Phiber Optik.<DD>But perhaps the most infamous hacker is Death Vegetable, or "Veggie," member of a group of hackers called the <B>Cult of the Dead Cow</b>.<DD>As an illustration of the authority-defying nature of hacker culture, on its Web page, the <B>cDc</b> warns that its site "may contain explicit descriptionsof, or advocate one or more of the following: nudity, satanism, suicide, sodomy, incest, bestiality, sadomasochism, adultery, murder, morbid violence,bad grammar, or any deviate sexual conduct in a violent context, or the useof illegal drugs or alcohol."<DD>The page also contains a quote from Thomas Jefferson that illustrates themore serious "hacker ethic" that claims "information should be free."  The quote is: "Those who desire to give up freedom in order to gain security, will not have, nor do they deserve, either one."<DD>Founded in 1985, the <B>cDc</b> claims to be the oldest group still active in thecomputer underground, and the only one with its own annual convention (<B>HoHoCon</b>).  It also claims to have disrupted communications on two continents by moving telecommunications satellites, and to have altered theenvironmental controls in local shopping malls by computer modem.</font><P><I>[More stuff not about us]</i><P><hr><center><a href="http://www.cultdeadcow.com/oldskool"><img border=0 src="cdcsmall.gif"><BR><h3>Cult of the Dead Cow</h3></a></center>
