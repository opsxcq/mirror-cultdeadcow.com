The founders of this nation, quite wise men,realized that the people were more than capable of being utter prats, and thus,placed many things outside the reach of "many people."  That is what theConstitution means when it says "Congress shall make no law."  It means nomatter how much the people whine, and beg, and scream, and whine, their electedrepresentatives DO NOT HAVE THE POWER TO CENSOR.<P><DD>     The people be damned.<P><DD>Everyone in the technology industries is concerned that the CommunicationsDecency Act will make the US non-competitive in international markets, becauseit will paralyze Internet service providers who will be forced to filter every single piece of personal email, every single Web page, and every single post made to Usenet through their ISP for potentially pornographic material. Which will make running an ISP in America impossible.<P><DD>Many people feel that the religious right, in their crusade to control theworld around them, do not realize that such strict laws will kill the US as amember of the Internet community.  They're not as stupid as people think theyare.  They know the situation.  They don't care. They want to rule, period, andif what they end up ruling is a fourth-rate backwater nation, that won'tmatter to them.  Just so long as they are in charge.<P><DD>They know about products such as "Surf Watch" which can restrict Internetaccess to certain content.  THEY DON'T CARE.  They do not want to protect theirchildren, they wish to enslave you.  They are not "misguided."  They are not"poorly informed."  They are not "concerned parents."  *THEY* *ARE* *EVIL*.And, as they will be the first to tell you, there is no compromise or treatywith evil.  The censors must be fought, and defeated, *by any means necessary*.By the ballot box if we can, by the cartridge box if we must.<P></h4><HR><P><center><a href="http://www.cultdeadcow.com/oldskool"><img border=0 src="cdcsmall.gif"><BR><h3>Cult of the Dead Cow</h3></a></center>
