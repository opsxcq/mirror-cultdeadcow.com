We operatein the bitter darkness outside the known channels.  We thrive in theferro-concrete walls of the technological civilization.  We are thestainless steel rats, gnawing at the underpinnings of the 'InformationSuperhighway', spreading the power and propaganda of the Cow whereverwe go.<BR><DD>     Founded in 1984, the <B>Cult of the Dead Cow (cDc)</b> is theoldest group still active in the computer underground; the only group(aside from a few layme p1RaT3 gR0oPzZz) with a female group member;the only group to host its own annual HoHoCon hacker convention;and, with over 300 text files in circulation, the most prolific group.cDc is definitely cooler than the <B>Legion of Doom (LoD)</b>, and moreimportantly, our T-shirts are more colorful.  We also have stickers.<BR><DD>     Great, you may say, but have we ever disrupted communications on twocontinents by moving telecommunications satellites?  Mhm.  Hacked computingresources belonging to the three-letter agencies and the Pentagon?  Yep. Altered environmental controls in local malls via modem?  Done that.  Butunlike other hacker groups you've undoubtedly read about, we've neverbeen caught.<BR><DD>     With qualifications like these, it's not surprising that over thepast few years, the media has looked to us as the darling boy (and girl)torch-bearers of the DIY-cyber-hacker-underground movement.  It's ourunfortunate cross to bear.  But as the whole of Generation X follows ourlead into the new millenium, we feel it is our duty to our peers tomaintain the struggle and "raise high our freak flag," as it were.<BR><DD>     On their behalf, we intend to dominate and subvert the media whereverpossible.  Information is a virus.  And we intend to infect all of you.<P><CENTER><h3>                            There is no vaccine.<BR>                            There is no escape.<BR>                            There is no hope. <BR></h3><h2>                            There is only cDc.</h2><P></center>What follows is the abridged update on our progress to taint your globalinformation outlets.

The files              are numbered sequentially, but since they are often written by              different people, they vary in style and content from issue to issue. Topics and form vary wildly, covering religion, defecation,              cows, simulated and real capture files from BBSs, politics,              hack/phreak articles, poetry, short stories, interviews,             and mindless raving.
