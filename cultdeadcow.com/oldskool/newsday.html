<title>cDc's response to Newsday magazine</title><body bgcolor=WHITE><body><h5>(re: http://www.newsday.com/plugin/ccov0421.htm)</h5><P><h4>Hey, I saw your article on Newsday which made reference to the<i>Cult of the Dead Cow</i> <b> (cDc)</b>.  I think your article really missed the mark, underestimating the power and the glory of the Cow.  Comparing cDc to E-zines like <I>Lady in the Radiator, Cat Machine, Mouse Potato,</i> and  <i>Et Tu Boo-Tay</i>?! We have them <i>all</i> beat, HANDS DOWN!<P>cDc is more than a 'zine.  We're a neo-Marxist, anarcho-socialist guerilla unit forged for the sole purpose of getting on TV.  We're the smart-ass doctoral student who hands in his thesis written in crayon on a Big Chieftablet.<P>We're the kid who monopolizes television news coverage, wavingand yelling, "Hi Mom!" in the background.<P>We're here to hurl watermelons into the windshields of oncominginfonauts.<P>Not only is cDc a secret society; a collection of the best computerhackers on the planet, but we're also the best and the brightest ofthe digiterati you're liable to find anywhere.<P>In the past year or two, it's become fashionable to upload yourschlock to a web site and call it a 'zine; four stars and a "Top 5%" award ifthe tone of your 'zine is cynical.  Lately, every time I pick up thepaper and read a column by an Internet-enthused journalist, it alwaysbegins, "I was on the 'Net way before any other journalist." Investment bankers who fancy themselves "Internet experts" are saying ludicrous things like, "If you put a TCP/IP stack on your Windows machine, itturns it into a Unix workstation," and <I>Wired</I> and <I>The Red Herring</i> are eating it up.<P>Ha!  We've been on-line and electronically distributing our 'zine formore than a decade!  We remember the glory days: when the "Internet"was still the Arpanet; when White Sands Missile Test Range maintained'guest' accounts with full privileges; when an Apple ][e with 128K ofmemory and an 80 column card was the computer to own.<P>"Battling to remain nonconformist"?  Ha!  We define it!  GeraldoRivera has denounced us on national TV; Bruce Sterling voted us "Most Likelyto Pillage the Global Village."<P>We're the NSA's worst nightmare: a hackinggroup with infinite computing resources and an inexhaustible supply oftalent and attitude.  You really think you can compare us to these other groups?<P>Hardly.  There's much more to the Cult of the Dead Cow than firstglance might suggest.  To give you a quick intro to us and our voluminouswritings, I'd like to suggest the following:<P>MIT Media Lab's "24 Hours in Cyberspace":<BR><a href="http://www.cyber24.com/htm/6_204.html">       http://www.cyber24.com/htm/6_204.html</a><P><a href="http://www.cultdeadcow.com/cDc_files/cDc-0200.txt">cDc #200 -K-b00midy B00midy B00m File</a><P><a href="../cDc_files/cDc-0320.txt">cDc #320 - TEMPEST in a Teapot</a><P><a href="../cDc_files/cDc-0275.txt">cDc #275 -Joseph Smith: Man, yes; Myth, maybe; Prophet, NEVER!</a><P><a href="../cDc_files/cDc-0040.txt">cDc #40 -Sex with Satan <i>(The file that got Geraldo's attention.)</i></a><P><a href="../cDc_files/cDc-0086.txt">cDc #86 -Screwdriver Flippin'</a><P>I think you'll find that there's no comparison between us and thealso-rans you mentioned in your article.<P>Thoughtfully yours,<P></h4><h3><DD>   Omega<DD>   <I>-cDc-</i></h3><hr><center><a href="http://www.cultdeadcow.com/oldskool"><img border=0 src="cdcsmall.gif"><BR><h3>Cult of the Dead Cow - Index</h3></a></center></body>
