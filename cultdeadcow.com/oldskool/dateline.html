If you want some control over what your child watches or listens to, you can lock out certain cable TV channels or even block out those 900 phone services.<P> <B>STONE P:</b> But there may be one device in your home over which you have little control when it comes to the information your child sends and receives.  And as Deborah Roberts reports, it's setting off an explosive chain of events.<P> <i>[CUT TO VIDEO OF IDIOT KIDS BLOWING UP MAILBOXES, TOSSING MOLOTOV COCKTAILS.]</i><p> <B>DEBORAH R:</B> This is what a group of 15 and 16 year old Texas boys did for kicks earlier this year.  They blew up mailboxes.  Tried to torch someone's home.  They even tossed home-made molotov cocktails into the street.  As if that weren't enough, the eight teenagers were even bold enough to record their mischief on this home video tape.  They were all later arrested.<P> If you're thinking that your child would never even know how to make an explosive.  Think again.  Especially if there's a computer in the house.<P> <i>[CUT TO CANADIAN 12-YEAR-OLD DIALING A BBS.]</I><P> Take the case of 12-year old Stephan Cruzy  of Montreal.  Like many of today's kids, he owns the latest computer, complete with music, games and something else his parents never counted on: a direct line into files on how to make explosives.<P> <B>STEPHAN C:</b> [unintelligible] stuff like smoke bombs.

Labelled <i>"Anarchy for Fun and Profit"</i>, it was written by someone named<B> Deth Vegetable.</b>  And inside there are step-by-step, easy-to-use instructions on how to make things like pipe bombs, and plastic explosives.  There's even a list of household products to substitute for hard-to-find chemicals.<P> <i>[CUT TO STEPHAN CUTTING SOMETHING FROM THE COVER OF A MAGAZINE ENTITLED "LIVING IN SAFETY"]</I><p> <B>STEPHAN'S MOM:</b> Cut this picture out.<br><b>DEBORAH ROBERTS:</b><i> [Over Stephan's Mom]</i>  Stephan's Mom found the information and stopped him before he could build anything...<P> <I>[CUT TO AMBULANCE RUSHING INTO HOSPITAL EMERGENCY AREA IN MONTREAL]</i><P> But no one was there to stop two other boys.

He wrote his bomb-making recipes and then placed them in what's called a computer bulletin board system.  Anyone with a telephone and a computer modem can call in and read them.  And there's nothing illegal about it.  It's all covered under Freedom of Speech.<P> <I>[CUT TO <B>DETH VEGETABLE</b> AND DEBORAH ROBERTS]</i><P> <B>DEBORAH R:</b> Why should this information be out there anyway for kids to get hold of?<P> <B>DETH VEGETABLE:</b> Why not?  I mean...<P> <B>DEBORAH R:</b> Should kids who are 10 or 12 years old be able to find out how to build a bomb?<P> <B>DETH VEGETABLE:</b> There shouldn't be legal limits.  It's not the government's place to limit this sort of thing.  Because once you let them start restricting one kind of information, they're going to restrict everything.<P> <i>[<b>DETH VEGETABLE</b> IS LOGGED ONTO<b> The Works</b> --<b> A CULT OF THE DEAD COW</b> SYSTEM.  <b>DETH VEGETABLE</b> IS SHOWING DEBORAH THE FILES SECTION.]</i><P> <B>DEBORAH R:</b> And since there are no restrictions, anyone who gets into the bulletin boards can copy whatever they want, which is how Veggie's information spread to Montreal, and how other bomb-making recipes made their way to the Midwest.<P> <i>[FADE TO SIGN THAT READS "BURR RIDGE."  THIS IS SUBURBIA, LATE WINTER OR EARLY SPRING.]</i><P> <B>DEBORAH R:</b> Burr Ridge, Illinois is a suburb of Chicago.  Well-known for its quiet streets and expensive homes.  But last year it took on a different reputation when someone began planting small bombs throughout the community, mainly in trash cans and mailboxes.  The local police called in Federal agents and what they found shocked even the most experienced officers.<P> <I>[CUT TO AN EXPERIENCED LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICER WITH A VERY BAD TOUPEE]</i><P> <B>DET. JOHN MADDEN:</b> I never expected to recover steel pipe bombs from a kid's playhouse -- if you want to call it that, or hangout.<P> <I>[CUT TO SCENE OF EXPENSIVE HOMES IN THIS QUIET SUBURBIA]</i><P> <B>DEBORAH R:</b> What Detective Madden uncovered was a ring of five teenagers who planted nearly 50 home-made bombs throughout Burr Ridge and a neighboring town.  Police found an arsenal of explosives stored over the garage of one of the boys' homes.  Enough they say to blow up the entire house.<P> <B>DEBORAH R:</b> What _is_ this?<P> <B>DET. MADDEN:</b> This is home-made Napalm.<P> <b>DEBORAH R:</b> Napalm?!  That's the same chemical used in Vietnam.  And there was more.  Including nine pipe-bombs almost ready to go.  An entire collection of fuses.  Plastic and metal pipes.  And bags and cannisters of chemicals and gun-powder.<P> <b>DEBORAH R:</b> So this would create quite an explosion.<P> <b>DET. MADDEN:</b> Exactly.  The shrapnel would be the thing that does the damage.  So, you can see how heavy this steel is.  And the steel fragments would be flying at approximately 3000 feet per second.<P> <b>DEBORAH R:</b> The five would-be bomb-makers also got their information from computer bulletin boards.  Police seized these print-outs as evidence.  Inside was this document.<P> <i>[CUT TO COMPUTER PRINT-OUT]</i><P> <B>DEBORAH R:</b> "REAL PIPE BOMBS", written by the so-called Dark Lords of Chaos.<P> <I>[CUT TO OFFICIAL-LOOKING BUREAU OF ALCOHOL, TOBACCO AND FIREARMS LOGO, SUPER-IMPOSED OVER MAP OF UNITED STATES.]</I><P> <B>DEBORAH R:</b> Kids and bomb-making are now a serious problem for the department of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms. <P>  <I>[MAP OF US HIGHLIGHTS ARIZONA, COLORADO, MISSOURI, INDIANA, ALABAMA, NEW JERSEY, CONNECTICUT.]</i><p> Officials are investigating at least twelve cases in seven states of young people making bombs with information they got from computer bulletin boards.<P>   <i>[CUT TO <B>DETH VEGETABLE</b> TYPING AT COMPUTER.

Usually from a publishing company like this one just outside Seattle.  It stocks more than 800 different kinds of bizarre and unusual books with titles you might not believe.  There's a book on the _Techniques of Silent Killing_; _Execution: Tools and Techniques_; _Kitchen-Improvised Plastic Explosives_.  It sounds like fiction.  But open them up and the information is all too real.<P> <I>[CUT TO DEBORAH ROBERTS WITH WHAT LOOKS LIKE THE PUBLISHER OF LOOMPANICS.

He's rounded up authors who've written on subjects like: _Building Your Own Bazooka_, _How to Commit a Successful Armed Robbery_, and _How to Make Knives and Guns in Prison_.  He also sells books on bomb-making.  Including this one: _Uncle Fester's Home Workshop Explosives_.  Police say it's information from books like these that ends up on computer bulletin boards.<P> <B>DEBORAH R:</b> What do you expect most people who order these books will do with them?  Just read them and that's it?<P> <B>MICHAEL H:</b> Yes.  Yes, I do.<P> <b>DEBORAH R:</b> So why...giving recipes, step-by-step instructions on either how to build a bomb or how to kill someone if you don't expect people will use it in that way.<P> <B>MICHAEL H:</b> Well, the information is useful for other purposes.  Any mystery writer, for example, would benefit greatly from a lot of the books in our catalog for research purposes.<P> <B>DEBORAH R:</b> Let me just read something.  It says, "Dangerous and caustic materials: so, a small bit of preaching is called here to help prevent needless accidents from befalling careless experimenters."  You're obviously suggesting here that people will experiment or try these recipes and make a bomb.<P> <B>MICHAEL H:</b> It's very possible that he's urging extreme caution and safety.<P> <B>DEBORAH R:</b> But what's the point anyway?  Why even give someone instructions on this?<P> <B>MICHAEL H:</b> It's a great American tradition to blow stuff up and blow stuff up real good.<P> <i>[CUT TO LOOMPANICS CATALOG WITH DISCLAIMER]</i><P> <B>DEBORAH R:</b> Hoy includes a disclaimer in his catalogs saying the books are for adults only, but he admits he will sell to anyone who sends in an order.<P> <B>DEBORAH R:</b> How do you control the hands that these books fall into?<P> <B>MICHAEL H:</b> We don't.<P> <B>DEBORAH R:</b> Does it bother you that you don't.<P> <B>MICHAEL H:</b> Uh, no.

I don't know these people.  I'm not happy that they hurt their fingers, or whatever, but it's not up to me to police other people's kids.  I'm not going to get into raising other people's kids.<P> <I>[DEBORAH ROBERTS NARRATES:</i> "That's a point not lost on Congressman Markey, who says it's up to parents to keep watch over their kids' computer habits."]<p> <B>MARKEY:</b> Parents have to wake up.

It was on Elansky's BBS in Connecticut where one copy of Deth Vegetable's file was found, nearly five years after he'd authored it.  The file is not all that remarkable and by Deth Vegetable's admission, hardly anybody in the community had ever heard of it.  As far as he knew, the file did not get much distribution.  The file had never been downloaded from Elansky's board (according to his logs) until the day the local police motivated a 14-year-old to download it so they could bust Elansky.  It was the publicity of that bust which sparked interest in Deth Vegetable's file, in the same way that the Knight Lightning bust sparked so much interest in a thoroughly boring and harmless file about the E911 system.  Kids' thinking was probably something like, "If the cops busted a board over <B>this</b> file, this file in particular out of hundreds like it, there must be something to it.  Where can I get it?!"  Shortly thereafter, kids in Montreal and elsewhere called anywhere they could think of to find it.<P>	These files have been on BBSs for over a decade.  Why are kids <B>now</b> suddenly blowing themselves up?  It's not because this kind of information has just become available to them.<P>	And if this matter is of such great urgency, why did Dateline postpone airing this segment till nearly two months after its originally-scheduled air-date, continually pre-empting it with OJ Simpson coverage?  Is OJ more of a threat to the public than the supposed proliferation of bomb-making recipes to America's teenagers?<P><HR><center><a href="http://www.cultdeadcow.com/oldskool"><img src="http://www.cultdeadcow.com/images/cdc.gif"><P><h3>Cult of the Dead Cow</h3></a></center>
