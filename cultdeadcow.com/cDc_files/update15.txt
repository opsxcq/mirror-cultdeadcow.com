It's kind of an inside joke.  'ceptain't nobody laughin'.252: "The Bishop" by Curtis Yarvin.  "Father McKenzie, writing the words of asermon that no one will hear..."  Lonely priest decides he'll be the Pope.  Andwho's to stop him?  Let's all be Pope.253: "Better, Stronger, Faster" by Omega, Reid Fleming & White Knight.  Amazingdocument hacked-out of a CIA computer reveals use of popular TV programstarring Lee Majors to cover up space alien presence.254: "Hung Like a Horse" by Krass Katt.  Blech.  Weird, kooky things go on atveterinary hospitals.255: "Mess o' Top Ten Lists" by The Death Vegetable & Iskra.  Like the titlesays.  It's humor, man, humor.256: "Fecal George" by David Humphrey.   Another blech one.  Nutty, crazycollege kids, eating anything for a quick buck.257: "Goodnight, Benjamin" by Tequila Willy.  Spooky, zany business.258: "Spontaneous Combustion and the Aryan Parade" by FLaMinG SeVeReD HeaD. They're on Demerol, they've got a '67 Camaro, and some fresh white mice to playwith.

CZ drops the skinny on the most recentmajor computer underground convention.260: "Vegas, 1976" by Mad Mac.  Snortin' coke and jacking off to a HINEY BOYmagazine in the bathroom of the Sands in Los Vegas just isn't safe anymore. __________________________________/cDc Gnuz\__________________________________           "cDc is the Meat group.

Sammy was a prince,baby, a prince.Stupid Computer Geek, Part X: "In October, Houston, Tex., computer enthusiastShawn Kevin Quinn, 17, pleaded no contest to putting out a murder contract onthe boyfriend of a girl he had eyes for.
