Our society has grown by three worthy newconverts.  We are also generously releasing ten new articles to the public,bringing our serial total to 320 in number.Our organization eschews traditional print-bound media for the electronicdistribution of our writings which we pioneered some ten years ago.  This mixof fiction and information is made available, free of charge, to all inter-ested persons and will be profiled in detail later in this communique'.The hardy new followers of our mystic path have strong backs, quick minds, andloyal hearts.  Joining our armed struggle is not to be taken lightly.  They,like all cDc members, have sworn to live by the tenets and protect the secretsof our ancient Gnostic cabal.  The only punishment for failure is death!Those who would cross the cloven-hoofed path of Hathor should fear for theirvery souls, as retribution is surely swift when She manifests as the awesomepower of DemonSeed Elite!But I digress.  What follows is a short biographical sketch of the newestinitiates to the CULT OF THE DEAD COW: Mudge, OXblood Ruffin, and Tweety Fish.Their real names cannot be made public, as doing so would place them in greatdanger.Mudge was separated from his parents on a camping trip as a toddler.  Lost andalone in the wilds of New Mexico, he was found by a female coyote and raisedas her own pup.  For six years he lived on berries, jackrabbits, and theoccasional stolen chicken which he hunted with his canine companions.  At theage of ten, a married couple (both physicists employed at the Atomic EnergyCommission's laboratories in Los Alamos) discovered his inhuman plight andadopted him.  It was under their strict home schooling that he discovered theworld of computers... and military networks.  Today he is one of the world'stop hackers and can still do a piercing coyote howl.OXblood Ruffin has roots as a farm boy in Canada.  Bored with plowing, he soonfound his role in the air as a hot-shot cropduster pilot.  His passion forexcitement led him to seek an RCAF assignment, but his unfortunate clubfootheld him back.  Undeterred, he found employment flying guns and refugees inthe skies over war-torn Laos and Cambodia until 1975.  Returning to his nativeRegina, he discovered the battlefield of politics to his liking and began astring of unsuccessful bids for office.  He has since given up his ownpolitical aspirations for the time being but serves as a speech writer forseveral major Canadian political figures.Tweety Fish saw the world as a young classical pianist prodigy.  His masterfulinterpretations were a delight to all who heard them.  Why, then, did hechoose to throw his budding career away by performing "Chopsticks" to anaudience including the English royal family?  Only Tweety Fish can answer forsure, but he returned home to Massachusetts and now refuses to so much astouch a piano keyboard.  He has since immersed himself in the study ofcommercial art and sociology.  Iconography is a powerful weapon in the handsof those who would twist it for their own whims.  No one understands thisbetter than Mr. Fish, who designs children's cereal boxes by day and performsnefarious cDc experiments by night.  Swine must be led to their trough.      _   _                                                          _   _     ((___))                INFORMATION IS JUNK MAIL                ((___))     [ x x ]                _                                       [ x x ]      \   /  _   |_|_   _ _|_  _|_ |_  _    _| _  _. _|   _ _        \   /      (' ') (_|_|| |_  (_) |    |_ | |(/_  (_|(/_(_|(_|  (_(_)\_/\_/ (' ')       (U)                                                            (U)      .ooM                     cDc communications                    .ooM  deal with it            NEW RELEASES FOR JUNE, 1996:           deal with it  ________________________________/text files\________________________________311: "If Six Was Nine" by OXblood Ruffin.
