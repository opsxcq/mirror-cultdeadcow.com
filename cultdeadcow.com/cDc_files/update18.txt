Once again, Oi brings the linguisticsfor the nine deuce deuce.  This one's got crazy subliminal tapes and a hippychick.284: "Sanford's Calico" by James Cazamias.  It's just like Disney's_That Darn Cat!_, but different.285: "Concise Guide to Forgetting How Much You Suck" by Jason Farnon.  Courtesyof the cool _I Bleed For This?_ 'zine, here we go with a cDc edit/distribution.

You should.  Really.287: "Shotgun" by Swamp Ratte'.  Never mind _Where's Waldo?_, where's theshotgun?  Oh my.  Fills out this release's angst quota.288: "Rejection Letter Blues" by Jeff Swanson.  Some people just can'tappreciate good literature.  Fun-eeEe.289: "Can There Be Artificial Intelligence?" by Tequila Willy.  Anotherscholarly scab for you to pick at.

Zany hi-jinx. __________________________________/cDc Gnuz\__________________________________                                           _       _                |\                        /^\     /^\                / /                     /  @ )^ -| @ )^ - _              / /           666        (  \/-^-^^|  /--^-^-~             \o \                       \ o \   /  /@ )^ - _              | o|         _  -  _        \  / o /|  /--^-^-~             /  /      /     O    o ^ -  /  ( O |/  / /\            | o \__ _/   O   o  O   o   ( o  \ o \ /_/@ |             \   o  o             o          /    |__ _ \\               \   o    O   \   O     ( o  -   o /  .  ^ \S                  - - \   o  )        \ (    ) /(_ / /^                       |    / - _  -  -   \   \ -_ -- -                       |  /    \  /         \  |   \ \.                      /  |      | \         |  \                    /_    \    / |  \      / _   \                       | \  -                  | \ -     "This low-go you've received is the image of the be east.

Yep.  There's now a Usenet newsgroup for you to discuss theAll-Powerfulness of cDc.  It's "alt.fan.cult-dead-cow" and if your newsfeedisn't getting it, mail news@yersite and say, "GET WITH THE PROGRAM, PAL!  HUPHUP!"Tell me about the time you were in the 7th grade and had to do a #2 really badand those blind special ed. kids were in the bathroom swinging their canesaround and saying bad words.  You were SCARED, weren't you.  HA!The world is filled with WIMPS.  You go to a large public restroom, into astall.  All the other people in the stalls, you can see their feet.  They makeno noise.  They sit and wait and clutch their tiny little genitals in FEAR. But I am NOT LIKE THEM.  I MAKE MY DISGUSTING NOISES AS I PLEASE.  I clean up,I exit my stall, I wash my hands and I LEAVE.  I AM DONE.  I AM RELIEVED.  Theyremain, cowering, wishing they had the GUTS to CRAP but they do not and theirbowels TREMBLE with gasses.  They are but INSECTS because they cannot CRAPFREELY.  LEARN FROM MY ACTIONS and you too can be POWERFUL.Lady Carolin is now running the Official cDc Internet Dumpster: ftp or gopherto cascade.net for all the cDc stuff, all the time.  Cascade.net gets 'em firstand fast.  The secondary site is ftp.eff.org as usual.The other day I finally got The Beatles' _Abbey Road_ album and this "I WantYou (She's So Heavy)" song is amazing.  So I'm thinking, why should I beconcerned with this week's indie-certified alterna-wonder-weenie when I DON'TEVEN HAVE A GOOD COPY OF BARRY MANILLOW'S "MANDY"?  MY 8-TRACK SUFFERS FROMEXTREME WOW AND FLUTTER.HOW CAN I EVEN _THINK_ ABOUT JAWBREAKER WHEN MY JACKSON 5 COLLECTION IS SADLYINCOMPLETE!!??If your writings have CLASS and STYLE, we want 'em.  Dig the address at thebottom of this file, daddy-o."What's good for cDc is good for America." - President Calvin CoolidgeS. Ratte'cDc/Editor and P|-|Ear13zz |_3@DeRrr"We're into t-files for the groupies and money."Middle finger for all.Write to: cDc communications, P.O.
