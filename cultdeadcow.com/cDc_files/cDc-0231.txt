Itossed my cigarettes down on the computer table, took out my Zippo, and satdown in the tattered brown swivel chair that I stole from my parents.  I hitthe switch on the power strip, and waited while the machinery noisily wounditself up.  When everything was ready, I hit the switch on the front of thecomputer, turning it on with a loud ping.     While the computer prepared itself for a night of work, I grabbed acigarette from the half-full pack of smokes, and lit it.  The lighter clankedclosed as the computer informed me that it was ready to get to work.  I tappedout a few keystrokes and decided to call down to the network to see if anyonewas around to talk to.	Talk isn't cheap anymore, but sometimes I find itsoothing.  It's an addiction, I know, but communications must be maintained.The cigarette glowed red with anticipation.     "Hey Paulie," said Liz, a 16 year old girl from Hyde Park, one of myfriends.     "Y'know, something is really moronic," declared Andy, in response tosomething that was said before my arrival.  I decided to respond to the commentanyway.     "It's me, I'll fess up."     "Sex with you... is all I want... and sometimes food," quoted Dwight, fromsome song he was listening to on the radio.     "I was sitting at KFC with two friends before the Teenage Fanclub show onFriday, and one of them, totally out of context, says '23,'" recited Liz,directing the statement to me.	Since I started to wear a cow tag with thenumber 23 on it, and proclaiming it to be the number of chaos and collapse,people have been flooding me with instances of the number's occurrence intotheir daily lives.     "Once you start looking, you can't stop," I said.     "Yeah.  It's like when you learn a new word, it shows up everywhere,"voiced Liz.     "Hey Liz, ice balls as precipitation," said Dwight, completely out ofnowhere.     By this time, my cigarette was long since burnt out, so I lit up anotherone and sat back to watch the words scroll by.	I was only vaguely payingattention, since conversation seemed as if it was going to be as inane asusual.	My lungs felt clogged; I felt tired.  I took another drag and returnedmy attention to the screen.     "My thoracic curvature is where my back is hurting," remarked Lackey toEriq.  They were talking among themselves about eveyday problems.     "How very existential," said Eriq to Lackey, who was now complainingabout something that I missed.     "Smile for me baby, let all the angst come through the camera," Imentioned for no reason.  A new person came onto the network and remainedsilent for a while, apparently trying to get a grip on exactly what was goingon with the rest of us.  Obviously, he failed.	Sometimes conversations likethis are hard to join in on.  He wasn't missing much of anything.  I felt aslonely as I did before I logged on.     "Why's everybody so happy?" said the newcomer and then left, leaving hiscontribution for the rest of us.     " Everybody's happy nowadays," quoted Dwight from an old Buzzcocks song.     "I'm not," I asserted.     "I'm not happy.  I'm miserable," said Lackey.     "Aww Lackey what's wrong?" asked Liz.     "Nobody loves me," he replied.     "I'm slightly depressed, but not completely.  That was earlier," saidEriq.     "I feel quite angstful at the moment," I added.  I was feeling a bit moreinterested in the conversation, so I decided to stay a little longer.  I lit upanother cigarette and let it wrap its ghostly tentacles around the stagnant airin my room, slowly eating away at my lungs.     "Life's an illusion, love is the dream," quoted Dwight, from yet anotherBuzzcocks song.     "Paul, you always feel angstful," declared Eriq to me.     I grinned into the void of the screen and said, "So what?"     "Love?  What love?" cried Lackey, as well as one could do through acomputer.  I felt for him.     "Love is overrated," uttered Eriq, slipping, at least in my mind, into asmoking jacket.  I smiled again, liking the way that the conversation wasturning.  I felt slightly energized, even if it was in a negative sort of way.A rush was coming on.  The ashtray was filling up quickly.     Eriq proceeded to explain a problem he was having with women.  It seemedthat he had two women that equally wanted his attentions, and he could notchoose which one he really wanted to be with.  I bemoaned my lack of a lovingrelationship and explained my wish for just one relationship.  "Here <handingPaul a relationship>," said Eriq.     "If only it were that easy," I voiced.     "If only we could turn our heads into breads we could slice them up andmake sandwiches," Dwight quoted again, this time from a King Missile song.     "Too bad women aren't commodities anymore," I said, sarcastically tonobody in particular.     "Ahem," expressed Eriq, trying to remind me that Liz was still around, andwould probably dislike that remark.     "Men are a pain," said Liz.     "I mean, ultimately, love is worth it, it's just such a pain sometimes..."remarked Eriq.     "I won't disagree with that," said Liz.     Strangely enough, the network computer added its own evaluation of theconversation, as it scrolled the following up the screen: "'Women are made tobe loved, not understood,' - Oscar Wilde.  'Women are made to be understood,not loved.' - Gloria Steinem."  Again I laughed to myself and looked over atthe blue glass ashtray, with its pile of cigarette butts starting to accumulatein an alarmingly great number.     "Actually, it's the delineation of expectations on the communicationsfront which seems to be a derailing factor," said Dwight, being crypticallyobtuse in his choice of language.     "Thanks.  Cleared everything up nicely," I said.  "I'm an absurdist.  Anda discordian as well for that matter, what other choices do I have?" I statedto Liz, who asked me about why exactly I said some things I said.     "What might a discordian be?" Liz asked.     "I can't tell you.  It's not a concrete ideology," I remarked, beingpurposely evasive, not wanting to get off the other topic.     "Paul is analog," said Eriq, in response to my comment, confusing thematter even more.     "Men bitch about women constantly....  Yet, they don't bother to tell ustheir feelings... you guys frustrate us too!" asserted Liz, returning to theoriginal topic.     "Whenever I tell a woman my feelings, they think I'm a wimp and won't haveanything to do with me," I said to Liz.     "If we didn't frustrate each other, then there wouldn't be any problems toovercome, and life would be boring," declared Dwight.     "Really, Paulie?" questioned Liz.     "Women SAY they want sensitivity, when they really want jerks to abusethem," I said to Liz.     "Relationships are what you want them to be.  No more and no less,"declared Liz.     "They have all these traditions inherited from the freemasons, and I thinkit's just plain weird," said Dwight, again returning to the nonsensical, butthen returning to the topic with: "I want relationships to be permanentlyexploratory, and binding at the participants' mutual request."     "Maybe I just date psychotic women," I uttered.     "Maybe," said Liz.     "Well, at least you date," voiced Lackey.     "Women all LOVE me as a friend, but never as anything more.  It gets to bea real pain in the ass," I said.     "Exactly, Paul," expressed Lackey.     "Amen," said Eriq.     "Paulie?" asked Liz.     "Yeah?"  I replied.     "It's wonderful to have friends.  And why would you want more if youaren't friends first?" asked Liz.     "Hormones."     "Shut up, Eriq," I remarked, and then lit another cigarette.  "I didn'tsay that I didn't want FRIENDS, and I could never be in a relationship where IWASN'T friends with someone," I said to Liz.     "Good.  <hugging Paulie>" commented Liz.     "It's just that I always end up as the Shoulder of Crying, and I end uphaving nowhere to go," I said, following up on my previous comment while takinga deep drag as I typed it.     "Night must fall now darker,darker," mentioned Lackey.     "You can only soak up so much of other people's problems, especially whenyou have plenty of your own," I said, and put out the nearly-dead smoke with myother hand.     "Exactly," asserted Lackey.  "That's why you should have an exactduplicate of you molded from sponge."     "Good idea, Eriq," I said.     "Yeah...  good point paulie," declared Liz.     "I love all of my female friends, and I wouldn't trade them for anything,but I need someone too." I said.     "We all need someone special, Paulie," related Liz.     "Needle.  Haystack.  Any questions?" said Dwight, obviously to someoneelse.     "Yeah, and that's what I really dislike.  When I date someone I always endup taking up all of their problems, and when they are done working them outthey leave me to be alone again," I uttered, while watching my second to lastcigarette burn away in the ashtray.     "WishesAreLikeDishesOurHalfMoonAtFullTiltFindsResurrectionInOrbitProfoundWithOmittedInflectionSwayOnClearWavesShakingOurSensesThenWhenWe'reTrueDownGoTheDefensesThenLetUsSpeakOfTheBrightOrTheBleak," said Dwight, trying to explainthe situation poetically.     I lit up my last cigarette, feeling the pressing weight upon my lungs.  Ilooked around my room and saw nothing.	The words scrolled past my eyes on thescreen.  Dwight's poem put an end to the other conversation, and I didn't feelmuch like talking to anyone anymore.  I ignored the passing conversation, andconcentrated on the glowing end of the final cigarette and thought of nothingbut the burning.  I smoked the last of the cigarette and smashed the butt outin the full ashtray.  I said my goodbyes to the remaining people on thenetwork, and signed off.  I shut the computer off, and got ready for bed.Before I got into bed I looked at the ashtray, wondering if I should emptyit.  No, I thought, that can wait until later.	I climbed into bed, leaving theashtray sitting on the desk, full of dead butts. _______  __________________________________________________________________/ _   _ \|Demon Roach Undrgrnd.806/794-4362|Kingdom of Shit.....806/794-1842| ((___)) |Cool Beans!..........510/THE-COOL|Polka AE {PW:KILL}..806/794-4362| [ x x ] |Metalland Southwest..713/468-5802|Moody Loners w/Guns.415/221-8608|  \   /  |The Works............617/861-8976|The Body Electric...916/673-8412|  (' ')  |ftp - zero.cypher.com in pub/cdc |ftp - ftp.eff.org in pub/cud/cdc|   (U)	 |==================================================================|  .ooM	 |Copr. 1993 cDc communications by Obscure Images      07/01/93-#231|\_______/|Seven SUPER-CALI-FRAGIL-ISTIC-EXPI-ALI-DOCIOUS years of cDc.
