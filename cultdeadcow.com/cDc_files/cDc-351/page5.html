<font size=+3>The Good And The Bad</font><p>


When that crash occurs, and you hit 'close', you'll notice that Netmeeting
itself does not close. This means that RUNDLL32 is being launched in a
separate process space. This is both good, and bad. The good side is that 
you don't have a lot of complicated code to wade through and whatever you do,
it won't look too suspicious, because Netmeeting didn't close. The bad side is
that RUNDLL32 doesn't load too much in the way of DLL's or external resources.
It looks like we'll have to load those on our own.<p>

Upon further inspection, we have even more shit to deal with. An executable,
such as RUNDLL32.exe has a base address of 0x00400000. This means that almost
all references to the stack are going to have at least one NULL character in 
them. This is unfortunate, because it is almost always runaway string 
operations in C that cause these kind of overflow problems. Hence, if we 
write our code with null characters, we will harm our own exploit string 
because it will be truncated as it is manipulated. Other bad characters 
include line feed, carriage returns, some control codes, and in some 
extreme cases, even lowercase or uppercase letters, or characters whose ASCII
value is greater &gt;= 0x80 (one of the worst cases!) We're just going to have
to be clever.<p>

Other things we have to work with: MSCONF.DLL is loaded. This is because RUNDLL
loaded it. We notice this because the command line for starting .CNF files is
"<tt>rundll32.exe msconf.dll,OpenConfLink %l</tt>" as defined in the CNF file
type. We can also assume that KERNEL32.DLL is loaded because KERNEL32 functions
are listed in RUNDLL32's import table. Then again, KERNEL32 functions are
also listed in the MSCONF.DLL import table. Lets look to see what would be 
more reliable: We're hacking Netmeeting 2.1. One version of the product. One
version of MSCONF.DLL. There could be any version or revision of RUNDLL32 or
KERNEL32 loaded from various OS versions or upgrades. Hence, if we were to
reference an absolute virtual memory address, it had better be within MSCONF
or else, we might be poking into the wrong places (version skew!). This is
problematic, assuming that we want this exploit to work on all versions of the
target OS.<p>

So... we look at how other programs get their addresses. We want to be able
to use internet functions to do fun stuff with our exploit code, so we are
going to need to use WSOCK32.DLL or WININET.DLL. WinInet provides more
functionality with less code, so we'll go with that for now. WININET is not
loaded into the process space of RUNDLL32, so we'd have to load it. But wait!
We haven't mentioned how to gain control of the EIP and point it to our
code yet! So we shall... <p>
