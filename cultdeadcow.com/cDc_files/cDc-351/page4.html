<font size=+3>How Can This Be Used?</font><p>

Now we need to figure out what's really going on. To create the buffer
overflow situation, I created a file called "overflow.cnf". CNF is a file
format used by Microsoft Netmeeting when you save a 'SpeedDial' shortcut to 
disk. CNF files are commonly placed on people's webpages and in emails so that
people on netmeeting will give them a call. <p>

If you wanted to exploit this overflow, you could simply start up Netmeeting,
find a bunch of people on the ILS server, and send them email with the CNF 
file attached. Just make the mail say something like: <i>My girlfriend and I 
want you to watch us fuck while you spank it! Call us soon, we're horny!</i> 
They'll click the icon. It may also be possible to fake a connection to an ILS
server as well, creating a fake user and supplying the bogus address line with
our exploit it in, so that if they click on the name, they get zapped. All 
kinds of fun owning the machines of horny men looking for titties on the 
net!<p>

So. Let's do it! What do we have at our disposal? Well, the overflow is in
'RUNDLL32.EXE', which is of different sizes between Windows 95 and Windows NT.
It's a safe bet to assume that they have different import tables (go ahead
and verify that yourself with DUMPBIN). Oh, by the way, this particular
overflow will only happen in Windows 95, but the exploit technology is valid
for Windows NT as well. Netmeeting 2.1 was the version, by the way.<p>
