<font size=+3>Constructing the Exploit</font><p>

We are now in control of the machine. We need to do something useful now, but
we are limited on how long we can make our code. You'll notice that after
about 763 characters, that we end up crashing in a different place. This is
also an overflow, a different one. So Microsoft really has two bugs to fix,
but hey, we're only exploiting one right now. If we have time, we'll get back
to the other.<p>

The first 256 characters get blown away so our code only has about 500 bytes
of room in which to fit. Here's what we have to deal with:<p>
<ul>
<li>500 byte maximum exploit length
<li>We don't know what OS version we're running
<li>We don't know where any useful functions are located
</ul>
This kinda sucks, but let's look at this from a non-exploit point of view.
If I was a little executable, compiled for Windows, I would run on both Win95
and WinNT. If I want to call ExitProcess, how do I know where the function is?
It's in two different locations in Kernel32.DLL between the two OS's. (and
in two different places between OSR1 and OSR2 of W95, and various service
pack releases of WinNT, for that matter). I can't just jump to a random
address.<p>

I have to be <b>told</b> the location of these functions. There is a function
in the Win32 API called "GetProcAddress". It returns the memory address of 
a function, given it's name and it's module handle. So what's the address
of GetProcAddress? We don't know! We would have to call it to find out! So how
does it work? Import tables.<p>

Import tables are structures in the PE-Executable format that specify that the
operating system should tell us the location of certain functions and fill 
in a table with the values. Use DUMPBIN to get the import table. Both DLLs and
EXEs have import tables. We know that MSCONF.DLL is in memory, and that since
we're only dealing with one version of MSCONF.DLL, if GetProcAddress was in
it's import table, then the address for GetProcAddress was written to a fixed
location in MSCONF.DLL's table space by the operating system when it was
loaded.<p>

So we dump it:<p>

Dump of file msconf.dll

File Type: DLL

  Section contains the following imports:

    KERNEL32.dll

                 23F   Sleep
                 183   IsBadReadPtr
                 17E   InterlockedIncrement
                 .
                 .
                 .
                  1E   CompareStringA
                  98   FreeLibrary
                 116   <font color=#C0FFFF>GetProcAddress</font>
                 190   <font color=#FFC0FF>LoadLibraryA</font>
                  4C   DeleteCriticalSection
                  51   DisableThreadLibraryCalls
                 .
                 .
                 .
</pre>
And there we are! <tt>GetProcAddress</tt>, and <tt>LoadLibraryA</tt>! <tt>LoadLibrary</tt> can be used
to get module handles of DLLs that are loaded, and to load DLLs that aren't
loaded. It basically returns the DLL base address. This is important because
the base address of the <tt>KERNEL32.DLL</tt> differs between NT and 95.<p>

So we pop into our debugger and search through memory until we find the 
address of the functions. They appear at <tt>0x6A60107C (LoadLibraryA)</tt>,
and <tt>0x6A601078 (GetProcAddress)</tt>. We just need to call these locations 
using an indirection (<tt>call dword ptr [0x6A60107C]</tt>) and we'll go to the
right places.<p>

In order to be efficient, we are going to build our exploit in two parts:
<ul>
<li>Build a jumptable of the functions we intend to use, and
<li>Run our code with reference to our own jumptable.
</ul> 
This reduces the amount of code required to call a function when necessary,
and minimizes stack usage to save registers. This is important, because if
we <tt>PUSH</tt> or <tt>POP</tt> too much, we might blow away our code or cause other stack 
problems.

In order to build this jumptable though, we'll need to know ahead of time
what Win32 functions we'll be calling. So lets figure out what we want to do.
500 bytes is far too small for a really useful Windows program, so instead,
we'll make our little <i>egg</i> code download another program off of the 
internet, a larger, well constructed executable, and execute it. This will
enable us to write this little tedious chunk once, and have it execute a piece
of higher level code.<p>

To download a URL, we'll need <tt>InternetOpenA</tt>, 
<tt>InternetCloseHandle</tt>, <tt>InternetOpenUrlA</tt>, and 
<tt>InternetReadFile</tt> from <tt>WININET.DLL</tt>. We'll also need
<tt>_lcreat</tt>,<tt> _lwrite</tt>, and <tt>_lclose</tt> from 
<tt>KERNEL32.DLL</tt> to write the file to disk once downloaded. We'll need 
<tt>GlobalAlloc</tt> from <tt>KERNEL32.DLL</tt> to allocate memory for what 
we're downloading. We'll also want <tt>WinExec</tt> and <tt>ExitProcess</tt> 
(also in <tt>KERNEL32.DLL</tt>) to execute what we've downloaded, and kill the
<tt>RUNDLL32</tt> process that we so thoroughly corrupted (before it can make 
a sound).<p>

Note that in a regular Win32 program, you would never call <tt>_lcreat</tt>,
or any of the other obsolete functions. However, they exist in Win95 and NT,
and they have far simpler calling syntax than <tt>CreateFile</tt> and friends.
So we'll use 'em.<p>
