Exploiting the buffer overflow takes patience, knowledge, skill, and
imagination. I can not teach you patience, and I can can not clear your
mind. I will however, give you the tools and concepts required to build 
your own exploits for buffer overflow bugs in the Windows 95, 98 and NT
operating systems.<p>

Before reading this document, you should be familiar with the following:
<ul>
<li>Intel x86 Assembly, preferably <a href="http://www.quantasm.com/freeinfo.html">Pentium</a>
<li>General Windows System Architechture (you should know what the PE means in the <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/specs/msdn_pecoff.htm">PE-Executable</a>)
<li>Know what a <a href="http://www.w3.org">URL</a> is.
<li>Have a working knowledge of C<p>
</ul>

The following tools are suggested to do anything useful:
<ul>
<li>A good hex editor/assembler/disassembler, such as <a href="hiew566.zip">HIEW</a>
<li>A realtime debugger, such as <a href="http://www.numega.com">SoftICE</a>
<li>A few tools that come with Visual C++, DUMPBIN specifically.
</ul>
After reading all of this, and gathering all of your tools, you may be 
thoroughly unprepared to read the following material. But hopefully you 
will understand what is so hard for so many to grasp. First, lets start 
with the very basics of what we are trying to understand. These are the 
fundamentals of buffer overflow.<p>
