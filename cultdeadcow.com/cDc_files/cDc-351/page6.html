<font size=+3>Snatching the EIP</font><p>

So we found that through a buffer overflow of the right length, we could
modify the return address of some function and jump to code of our choice.
It would seem natural then, for us to do something like the following:<p>
<pre>
Address=.....256periods....1234xyz
</pre>

Since the buffer size is 256 bytes (we figure that out by experimentation,
slowly growing and shrinking the address= line length until we home in on the
exact number of characters that cause it to crash) the above string will
fill the buffer with 256 periods, overwrite EBP with 0x34333231 and set
EIP to 0x00ZZYYXX, since the string ends with a null terminator. This lets
us point to wherever we want in the stack because guess what, we're allowed
1 NULL at the very end!<p>

In some cases, this works fine. But in other cases, the buffer is either too
small for this to work and do something useful, or the buffer is first munged
by a bunch of string ops or parsing. In many cases, putting the code AFTER
the return address is a better idea, as follows:<p>

<pre>
Address=.....256periods....1234wxyzOURCODEFOLLOWSHERE>>>
</pre>

In this case, you often get a lot more code space to work with for writing
your exploit, but we don't get the added benefit of getting a free null
character to form our stack jump address. Turns out that putting the code 
after the return address is what we'll need to do for this exploit. The stuff
before the return address is destroyed before we get a chance to work with it.
We end up jumping to 0xZZYYXXWW, where neither WW,XX,YY, or ZZ can be invalid 
chars. So where do we go? Somewhere that can take us where we want 
to go.<p>

First, turn on your realtime debugger and put in an exploit string that will
surely cause the thing to crash. Something that points to a blatantly bad
address (set 0xZZYYXXWW to equal 0x34333231 for example. No code is in memory there, instant page fault). Now run it and let your debugger kick in. Examine
the state, and see what you have to work with. In the case of this exploit,
we find that ESP is the only register that points to anything anywhere near
our exploit code. In fact, it points to the location where we blew over the
saved EBP, plus 16 bytes. Ok... So what exactly are we trying to do?<p>

We want to jump the stack. In fact, simply jumping to ESP should be sufficient.
A clever way to do this is to set the 0xZZYYXXWW to point to a piece of code
in memory that does a "jmp esp" or a "call esp" or something like that. But,
to complicate issues, it has to be in a piece of code where no byte in the
address is a "bad byte", especially <tt>0x00</tt>. We find our magic code in
MSCONF.DLL, loaded at 0x6A600000, offset 2A76:

<pre>
.00002A76: 54                           push   esp
.00002A77: 2404                         and    al,004
.00002A79: 33C0                         xor    eax,eax
.00002A7B: 8A0A                         mov    cl,[edx]
.00002A7D: 84C9                         test   cl,cl
.00002A7F: 740F                         je    .000002A90   
.00002A81: 80E930                       sub    cl,030  ;"0"
.00002A84: 8D0480                       lea    eax,[eax][eax]*4
.00002A87: 0FB6C9                       movzx  ecx,cl
.00002A8A: 42                           inc    edx
.00002A8B: 8D0441                       lea    eax,[ecx][eax]*2
.00002A8E: EBEB                         jmps  .000002A7B
.00002A90: C20400                       retn   00004
</pre>

This code doesn't look like it jumps to esp, but that's because it doesn't.
It <i>returns</i> to ESP. The PUSH ESP happens, the jmps 2A7B happens once,
then the JE 2A90 kicks in and pops us to a RET. This effectively jumps us
to ESP. Heh. So all is well. MSCONF.DLL is loaded, and we can expect that this
code is going to be in the same place all the time because we only have one
version of MSCONF.DLL to worry about, and it has a fixed DLL base address.
So our value of 0xZZYYXXWW is 0x6A602A76. No nulls, no bad chars, no bullshit.
We have now snatched the EIP. The processor is ours. Now to do something
useful...<p>
