Hell's been a' poppin' with the cDc since our last Global Dominatrix
Update.  We're gettin' famous all over Russia. No shit. The Russian
version of Computerworld put out an <A HREF="http://gorod.ttn.ru/cw/1998/04/internet/">article</A> about us. Hey, Igor - send me
some fuckin' vodka. Oh yeah, and those rat bastids in Beijing are still
searchin' high and low for the <A HREF="http://www.wired.com/wired/5.12/updata.html">Hong Kong Blondes</A>. The day those dickheads
find Blondie Wong will be the day George Michael learns to keep his dick
in his dungarees. What else? Um, uh, who cares? We don't have time to
write these <A HREF="http://www.cultdeadcow.com/cDc_files/updates.html">update</A> things. Just read the <A HREF="index.html">files</A>, ya foul smellin', black
clothes wearin', eunuchs [sp?] lovin' <A HREF="http://www.newhackcity.net">techno weasels</A>.

351:"<A HREF="cDc-351/index.html">The Tao of Windows Buffer Overflow</A>" by Dildog. If it wasn't for
Chairman Bill, hackers would have almost nothin' to do. Take Microsoft's
Netmeeting 2.1, for instance. Really take it. Wheeee.
&nbsp;
352:"<A HREF="cDc-0352.txt">Remembrance of Things Past</A>" by Pixie. So young, so wise. What can you
say about a girlie that makes sense when those so-called digerati over at,
er, what's the name of that shitty magazine? Aw, how cares? Just read this!
&nbsp;
353:"<A HREF="cDc-0353.txt">Pulp Philosophy</A>" by Shadeshifter. Greece was the birthplace of Olivia
Newton-John and John Travolta. It was also the birthplace of sodomy and
the Socratic dialogues. Quod licet Jovi, non decit bovi. ooM.
&nbsp;
354:"<A HREF="cDc-0354.txt">Unchained</A>" by Isis. She planted more wood in the American heartland
than the U.S. Forrestry Service with her last file (cDc #<A HREF="cDc-0344.txt">344</A>). And now
you're bound to love her - and will come to respect her - as we all have.
&nbsp;
355:"<A HREF="cDc-0355.txt">Shit-Burnin'</A>" by Cal Jacobson. This high security document was just
leaked to the cDc. Learn the truth about how your tax dollars are spent.
Somethin's got a high stank on it, and it ain't Sunspot's cologne. Whew.

* Carolyn Meinel: Gotcher note, babe.  Apology accepted.
  But we're still going to have to write "Can't play well with others"
  in your permanent record.

* Finally, someone who realizes how ridiculously stupid the "Wow, I can
  watch TeeVee on my cOmPuTeR!" hype is.  I wonder if the dolts at Red
  Herring and Wired have read this?

Fools better recognize: CULT OF THE DEAD COW is a gift to the women of
this world and the trademark of cDc communications.  Established in 1984,
the cDc is the largest and oldest krewe in telecom, inventor of the e-zine
and stool loosener to sysadmins everywhere.  Each and every issue is
produced on an Apple II for genuine effect. Yo, bee-atch! Find the flavor
at these fine locations:
