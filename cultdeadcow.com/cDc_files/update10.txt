We start '93 off right with thisstrong cDc debut from Deth Veggie.  An artist with a shotgun?  You KNOW it'sgonna be rad.202: "Monster Jennifer, or Celibacy Can Kill You" by Omega.  Another '93 cDcdebut by Omega, sysop of Moody Loners With Handguns BBS and author of a techarticle published in the November, '92 issue of MONDO 2000.  Let's sing!"Jennifer, hey, it's Jennifer... she's got a penis, hey wow, she's reallybeautiful and kinda crazy... HEY!  IT'S JENNIFER!"203: "The Briefing" by Reid Fleming.  Yet ANOTHER cDc debut, this one agripping tale of political intrigue and space aliens.  "Mr. President, you'reNOT on Candid Camera."204: "Life in General" by Video Vindicator.  Mr. Fraud himself takes keyboardin hand to deliver a heaping batch of opinions for you to ponder.  He disseslame females!  He disses lame cars!  This file's got it all!205: "That Which Strikes Terror Into the Hearts of Men" by Lady Carolin.  Acreepy old house, a dorky womanizer, and a mad grrrl with a chainsaw boogiedown!  Wooh!  It's the battle of the sexes!  ACTION!  ZOW!!206: "The Power of Art" by THE NIGHTSTALKER.  It's the crazed man with feces onhis mind, mailing lumps of his bowel's best work to the President's lovelydaughter.  How touching!  Never let it be said that cDc lacks tender-heartedaffection!  We're all very fuzzy and warm.207: "F23" by Obscure Images.  Ominous cyberpunk innuendo stuff withmind-control and Catholic confessions.  You know it's REAL cyberpunk 'cause itwas a t-file FIRST.  "Agrippa what?"208: "A Visit to the Slaughterhouse" by Transderm-Nitro.  Hey hey - let's go ona pleasant little jaunt down to the slaughterhouse and kill us some cows! Yeehaw.  It's educational - Mr. Nitro breaks it on down for YOU.  Dead cows,it's a subject EVERYONE's interested in.209: "Helmet Interview: July 17, 1992" by G.A. Ellsworth.  Transcription ofG.A. interviewing Page Hamilton, singer and bandleader of Helmet.210: "My Shit, and How to Strangle It" by Tequila Willy.  He's wacky and he'sgot intestinal worms!

We're back!  After a year of being casual and putting together the cDc#200 B00MIDY file, we return in '93 to wreck things completely.  On the firstday of the year we pounce at the 'puter underground with ten fresh new vicioust-files.  It feels g00d.  H00ray!Thanks to Drunkfux for setting up another spiffy HoHoCon in December.  I thinkeveryone had a good time and learned something.cDc welcomes three new people to the Stupendous Herd: Omega, Count Zero, andReid Fleming.  Clap clap.Internet!  The Electronic Frontier Foundation has set up a cDc directory ontheir server for easy leeching.  The site is at ftp.eff.org, and all the cDcfiles are in the directory pub/cud/cdc.  We urge you to support the EFF andtheir efforts looking out for YOUR cyber-butt.NEW cDc boards:Cool Beans!  (formerly Nihilism) sysop:G.A.

Upload text toThe Polka AE or Demon Roach Underground BBS, or send disks or hardcopy to thecDc post office box in Lubbock, TX.Sysops!  We're also always looking for new Factory Direct Outlets.  If you runa stable board and intend to keep it running for a while, then get in touchwith us if you're interested.I think that about wraps it up for this release.  The next GD Update will haveinfo on Lady Carolin's 'zine, and G.A. is working on a 'zine too, so maybethat'll be done by then.  Some Cultees are working on interesting GIFs, andthere should be a new bunch of cDc t-shirts soon.S.
