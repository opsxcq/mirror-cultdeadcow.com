  _   _ ((___)) [ x x ] cDc communications  \   /  Global Domination Update  (' ')  #9 - October 31, 1991   (U) New gNu NEW gnU new GnU nEW gNu neW gnu nEw releases for October, 1991:  194: "SatanTrek" by Necrovore.  Follow us now on a journey to rid Cyberspace ofevil virus writers.  Yeah.  This is an edited version of Necrovore's (formerly"The Raver") 1988 file.  It seemed an appropriate time for this re-release,what with the date and the demise of Gene Roddenberry (RIP). 195: "Earth Goo" by Lady Carolin.  On a cheerier note, LC the Social Workergives her impressions of real-life child abuse she faced in her work.I don't know what else to say, it's pretty intense. 196: "Interesting Things to Do With a Scanner" by The Mad Hatter.  Realize yourscanner's full potential as an entertainment and information-snatching device. Loaded to the gills with advice and frequencies.  Packed with peanuts.  Barrelfull o' monkeys. 197: "Ruth" by Obscure Images.  True-to-life account of one man's flusteredlove affliction.  Pain, agony, puking... this one really captures the wholeemotional experience.  Major angst. 198: "Some General Observations" by THE NIGHTSTALKER.  Like the title says;this one covers stereotyping in the service economy, white trash, telephonepolling, how to listen to other people having sex through a radio, and secretsof the pornography industry.  Yes, cDc IS variety. 199: "Presumed Guilty" by Andrew Schneider and Mary Pat Flaherty.  Yes, we'vegot trouble, right here in River City... that starts with "t" and ends with "e"and it stands for "seizure and forfeiture laws."  (Thank you, thank you...you're so kind.)  Your very own protectin' and servin' U.S. police force cantake possession of everything you own without even charging you with a crime,much less finding you guilty of anything.  Why?  Read the file and find out. In more civilized times this was called "theft," or "looting," or perhaps"raping and pillaging of the townsfolk," but now it's just called a byproductof the "War on Drugs."  ______________________________________________________________________________ Other telecom gnuz: Coming for December release will be cDc's 200th file.  It will be another "BamBam" issue similar to #100 and we're looking for submissions.
