      BACK ORIFICE        BLONDIE TALKS      THE NIGHTSTALKER RISES UP
&nbsp;
Whether you're a longtime fan of the cDc's t-files, or just another bored
analyst with the Rand Corporation, you'll be all over this file pack.
Damn, we're good.
&nbsp;
Once again, the CULT OF THE DEAD COW has got the poop for you on
Microsoft.  Introducing "<A HREF="../news/back_orifice.txt">Back Orifice</A>", the app that can squeeze right
onto your favorite Windows network or even the Internet. We'll be
introducing it at Defcon in Vegas on July 31, after which you'll be able
to download your very own copy for free.  We'd love to let you have the
super freakin' tools that we use to read Janet Reno's email but they'd be
way too much for you to handle -- sorta like a weekend with <A HREF="cDc-0354.txt">Isis</A>. So just
be grateful for BackOrifice, ya smelly little punks.
&nbsp;
We pulled off another first. Hong Kong Blondes' top noodle Blondie Wong
gives his first interview to the CULT OF THE DEAD COW. We almost feel
sorry for those fools in Beijing. They have about as much chance of
keeping the Blondes away from their satellites as Linda Tripp does of
making new friends. Sad, really -- but fuck 'em both. And after you finish
readin' the big interview, you just might get inspired and start your
very own chapter of the Yellow Pages. Go ahead, be a hero. But don't come
whinin' to us if ya get busted.
&nbsp;
And finally, the CULT OF THE DEAD COW'S resident munitions expert and
keeper of the Queen's English, the Nightstalker, recently hijacked a
truckload of Viagra. When we went to press, Federal Agents were out
looking for hardened criminals instead of the guy who used to use a
forklift to get it up. Now he's out there waving his freak flag high --
on the end of his wiener.  Right on, brother!

356: "<A HREF="cDc-0356.html">The Longer March</A>" by Oxblood Ruffin. The revolution's gone online
and it ain't gonna be pretty. Learn all you need to know about human
rights, hacktivism, American business, designer clothing, and more. 
The Mao the merrier.
&nbsp;
357: "<A HREF="cDc-357/index.html">Flag Rant</A>" by The Nightstalker. How many Vietnam vets does it take
to change a lightbulb? You know why you don't know? BECAUSE YOU WEREN'T
FUCKING THERE! After this file you'll never think of the flag the same
again.
&nbsp;
358: "<A HREF="cDc-0358.txt">San Francisco Cab Driver Stories</A>" by G.A. Ellsworth. If Keith Richards
was Travis Bickle's prison bitch then, uh, justa minute, I lost my train of
thought here. Oh, yeah.  If you ever end up in San Francisco and need a cab,
you'd better walk.
&nbsp;
359: "<A HREF="cDc-0359.txt">Dark Harvest</A>" by Sangfroid. One day you wake up and read that a
crackhead just murdered a friend of yours. You: a) stop reading
newspapers; b) blame the drug czar; c) write a file for the cDc. Choose
wisely.
&nbsp;
360: "<A HREF="cDc-0360.html">The Journalist's Cookbook</A>" by Reid Fleming. Is it tongue is sheik,
or does this guy really have the system licked? The cDc's own man of steel
breaks down the science so that anyone could interview a real live hacker and
sound smart. Honest.
