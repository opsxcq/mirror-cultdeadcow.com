What with George Clooney hopping onto Princess Diana'scoffin to settle old scores with the tabloids, it's been hell trying to get a word in edgewise. But we bear our burdens and move on. And so it is -- aftermuch grieving and maudlin songs -- that the CULT OF THE DEAD COW releases twofile packs of five files each, anoints one new member and expands on ourwork with the Hong Kong Blondes.  As our young people skip off to school, lunch pails bursting with wholesome treats and whistling their favorite video bits, we at the CULT OF THE DEAD COW DISTANCE LEARNING CENTER have labored long and hard to shine a light in the darkness -- sort of like high-beams along the information superhighway.Our crack team of learning experts have put together a wack packet of mind expanding mayhem in the hope that it will be the one thing that keeps our youth from purchasing firearms, or seeking employment in Redmond. We take special pride in announcing a new member to our ranks who goes by the name, SirDystic. He is rumored to be the child of Seymour Cray and an unknown showgirl. We found him living in a dumpster with a Palm Pilot, a case of Astroglide and his latest text file. Remember the Internet worm? Imagine thesame thing, only _bigger_. An automated, systemic infection of the Internet --all made possible because of the success of Bill Gates' dream of a computer inevery home, running Windows. With a little work and SirDystic's file, this isjust one possibility.It was a long hot summer for the HERD. The heat off the flashpacks and klieg lights at DefCon and H.O.P.E. were trying, but they come with the territory. Grandmaster Ratte's breakthrough performance at DefCon was the talk of Las Vegas, as was Microsoft's idle promise to give cDc Hacker Laureate Mudge the keys to the kingdom. Kaiser Wilhelm's star braun-nosers, Karan Khanna (head of NT Marketing) and Paul Leech (one of the main developers and author of the CIFS specification) promised Mudge a subscription to DevNet for a year and a link to the L0pht's site from Microsoft's Web page. Waiting - still waiting.And of the many happy memories at H.O.P.E., the CULT OF THE DEAD COW'S official announcement of our strategic alliance with the Hong Kong Blondes was received to deafening applause. The Hong Kong Blondes are a group of computer scientists and human rights activists who have taken the revolution on-line. They are active in Hong Kong, Shanghai and Beijing. And you can bet you'll be hearing a lot more about the real meaning of payback if the government of geriatric kleptocrats don't keep their word on social reform. Check the new cDc homepage (www.cultdeadcow.com) for future announcements. And support human rights in China -- the cDc does.Oh, one last morsel. The CULT OF THE DEAD COW has been requested by the Electronic Frontier Foundation to take over the EFF's ftp archives. The circle is now complete. The group that for so long has contributed to the computer underground will soon become the official custodian of its content. (Look for a full announcement soon.) And you thought we didn't have a plan. Damn, we're good.       _   _                the tedium is  the message                _   _     ((___))                INFORMATION IS JUNK MAIL                ((___))     [ x x ]                _                                       [ x x ]      \   /  _   |_|_   _ _|_  _|_ |_  _    _| _  _. _|   _ _        \   /      (' ') (_|_|| |_  (_) |    |_ | |(/_  (_|(/_(_|(_|  (_(_)\_/\_/ (' ')       (U)                                                            (U)      .ooM                     cDc communications                    .ooM  deal with it          NEW RELEASES FOR SEPTEMBER, 1997:        deal with it ________________________________/text files\________________________________331:"Angry Sun" by Franken Gibe.
