Big heap o' fresh album reviews from the manwhose nose knows.  EE!  This one features new releases from Bad Brains,Black Flag, Dead Milkmen, Fugazi, Holy Rollers, Judge, Neurosis, Scatterbrain,Social Distortion, and Warzone.  Root it up, boyee.135: "Trickledown" by Josh Whalen.  A car chase, bike riding, lust for pocketchange, rioting crowds, and a clever social message... what more could you wantin a t-file?136: "The Coming of Angels" by Obscure Images.  He was left behind to die inthe acid rain-drenched world.  From his decay, a new race emerged with onemission.  More psycho-drama from the man who knows gnus' noses.137: "Mourning in America" by Steve Ross.  Your elected representative may bein trouble!  But do you know the warning signs?  An in-depth look at politiciansuicides.138: "Life Sentence" by The Pusher.  It had gone too far... the pills and discowouldn't do it anymore.  He wants blood.  And he hates refrigerators._______________________________________________________________________________Other telecom gnuz:New (kinda) cDc BBS: NIHILISM, sysoped by G.A. Ellsworth, is up at 415/285-9453(PCP:CAOAK).  This was formerly PURE NIHILISM in 517; G.A. moved and set theboard back up after several months.cDc also welcomes THE NIGHTSTALKER into the Moo Crew... one more convert to thegrand cause.Gone cDc BBS: Unfortunately, The Convent run by Lady Carolin went down lastmonth due to people moving about.  It may go up sometime in the future, or itmay not.More gone boards: Ripco BBS and Billionaire Boys' Club were confiscated due toOperation Sun Devil, a major fed bust.  Ripco is the third major t-file BBS(along with The Metal AE and The Convent) to go down recently... bad situation.Ripco was the main t-file BBS in the country and had been online for 5 1/2years.  It'll be missed, and good luck to Dr. Ripco with the fed problems._______________________________________________________________________________cDc Global Domination Update #3 - by S.
