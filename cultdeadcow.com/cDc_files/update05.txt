A true tale of brutal justice - bloodthirsty vermin get their comeuppance.150: "INJUSTICE FOR ALL: A Guide to U.S. Pot Laws" by Judy McGuire.  This filewas typed up by Major Havoc of the Buzzz Bros group and given to cDc fordistribution purposes.  Learn the penalties in YOUR state for marijuanaoffenses.151: "Sex, Ecstasy and the Psychedelic Drugs" by R.E.L. Masters.  Another filefrom the Buzzz Bros; this one concerns research on sexual experiences whileunder the influence of psychedelics.152: "cDc core #6" by The Pusher.  The Pusher once again lets you know what'snecessary for your continued survival upon this planet and what's total trashin the realm of hardcore ball-busting music.  Yeehaw.153: "Excerpts from BLADE BARRIER Book #3" by Dean Tetreault.  Pile o' shortstories about a dead friend's body and people with Superfriends tattoos. K-rad?  You bet!154: "The Jolly One" by The Usenet Oracle.  Yes, Virginia, there is a SantaClaus... AND HE WANTS YOUR BRAIN!!155: "No Experience Necessary" by The Pusher.  In this original story, anhonest but dim-witted ex-cop is hired by "the firm" as the new Angel of Death. Includes a startlingly realistic cameo appearance by Satan as a lawyer. ______________________________________________________________________________Other telecom gnuz:New cDc BBS: Dave Ferret and his board The Works (617/861-8976) have joinedcDc.  The Works is a long-running t-file oriented board; its 3000+ t-fileson-line make it the largest such board in the U.S.Up again: G.A. Ellsworth has moved NIHILISM from the 415 area back to 513,specifically 513/767-7892.  Things are sure to be rolling in a chilly-the-mostway shortly, so get involved quick.  On-line are all the cDc releases, as wellas a working record catalog and other nifty stuff.Not up: Lady Carolin's Grassroots BBS (formerly The Convent) will be set upsometime in the future when she moves to the Great Pacific Northwest.New members of the Stupendously Glorious Herd: White Knight and The DethVegetable, as well as the aforementioned Dave Ferret.  Returning back to anactive position are long-time cultees Tarkin Darklighter (former sysop of DSFDevastator in 214) and Mr. Drunkfux.Ripco is back!  Yep... same # (312/528-5020), different computer, andsomewhat lacking in t-files.  Get an account and upload something; you'veprobably leeched enough from it in the past.Other important boards:Face to Face (713/242-6853) has been set up for members of the computerunderground to discuss telecom and legal issues along with "da fedz", all areinvited.  It kind of takes up where Phreak Klass 2600 and the Phoenix Projectleft off.The Magnetic Page (215/387-1182), sysoped by The Pook, has returned after along absence.  It's a great old Apple II-run board, with original software, andit's good to see it back.So that's it for January... we had taken a break for a few months so the newshad accumulated a bit since the last GD Update.  If you want to write us, theaddress is: cDc communications, P.O. Box 53011, Lubbock, TX 79453.  Feel freeto send money and consumer electronics, or items for t-files.  Whatever.'till the next release,S.
