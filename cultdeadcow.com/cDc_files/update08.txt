He knows that he has a nose for music, andin this up-to-date file The Pusher blows a big wad of snot to enlighten YOU,the music-buying public.  Notice that I'm getting desperate for descriptivephrases to put in these Updates....184: "It Looked Back at Me" by Tequila Willy.  With a character named"Purloined Sirloin," how can you go wrong?  Parental discretion IS advised, asthis file contains belching.185: "The Future" by Alien Hin.  Frightening story of a potentialpost-nuclear-holocaust future ruled by Christian Reformists with someeditorializing at the end.  Read it and think.186 & 187: "Hip-Hop Primer #2" (Parts 1 and 2) by Mark Dery.  Another bunch ofhard-to-find information and history of hip-hop music.  These files go intogreater depth than "Hip-Hop Primer" (#179) which was more of an overview of thetopic.  Like that file, if you're interested in the music you should checkthese out.188: "The Illusion of Motion" by Tequila Willy.  TW, debating genius/smart-ass,PROVES that you haven't moved an inch since the day you were born.  Alert thepress.189: "My Circumcision" by Franken Gibe.  Long-lost cofounder of cDc returnswith a brand-new startling tale of excess penis material.190: "The Greater of Two Evils" by Obscure Images.  Tragedy tragedy.  Oi'slatest proves the time-tested moral: "Don't jump to conclusions."  "Don't countyour chickens before they've hatched."  "Don't count your money 'till you'vesold your stocks."  "Don't buy any Clearasil 'till your zits have popped."191: "The Jesus Lizard Interview" by G.A. Ellsworth.  Matt The Much-Travelledtranscribes an interview he conducted with The Jesus Lizard, a darn cool band.192: "Compact Disc Scam" by Tequila Willy.  Willy, fine upstanding citizen,lets you in on his latest plot to extort free CD's from unsuspecting "musicclubs."193: "Butch" by Jane Delynn.  A young lesbian lady lover is lost in a loopwithout love. ______________________________________________________________________________Other telecom gnuz:New cDc system: Franken Gibe, former sysop of <astle <atatonic about five yearsago and cofounder of cDc, has set up a new system at 806/794-1842.  It's nowknown as Kingdom of Shit and presently maxes out at 1200 baud.Dive deep into The Shit, won't you?Yes, we've finally set up a distribution board plan: After a lot ofconsideration, we've decided upon a way to handle distribution boards.  Thedistribution setup is starting this month, with the title of "Official cDcGlobal Domination Factory Direct Outlets."  Obscure Images thought up the name.All Outlet boards will have the latest cDc files shortly after the release dateto make it easier for more people to get a hold of them.  All interested sysopsshould contact a cDc member about this-there's some good board advertising init for you.Two-hundredth file: cDc is coming up on the 200th release and we're consideringputting out a "#200 S00per BamBam File" in the same vein is #100.  If there'ssome sort of submission you'd like to make, e-mail it to me on any cDc board.NEW Official cDc Global Domination Factory Direct Outlets:The Floating Pancreas BBS  305/551-0311Info Addict [SWEDEN]       +46-498-22113Trend                      806/794-8828That's it for this month,S.
