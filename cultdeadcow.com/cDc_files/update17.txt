  _   _ ((___)) [ x x ] cDc communications  \   /  Global Domination Update #17  (' ')  August 1st, 1994   (U)Est. 1986New gNu NEW gnU new GnU nEW gNu neW gnu nEw GNU releases for August, 1994: _________________________________/Text Files\_________________________________271: "Alvin Harper, Teen Killer" by Krass Katt.  True account of horribledoings.272: "Curious Lack of Vigor" by Clench.  Three crazy people.  They're nuts. It's amazing, just how nuts they are.273: "Dumb and Isolated" by Franken Gibe.  Autobiographical file, aptly titled.HA!  Ha.274: "MaxiSpak Banana" by R.M. Wood.  It's about a new videogame system, 'ceptit's not real so it's funny.  Yes?  You betcha.275: "Joseph Smith: Man, Yes; Myth, Maybe; Prophet, NEVER!"  by Krass Katt. Or, "Why the Mormon Church is a Huge Scam."  Mega-fat file on Joseph Smith,founder of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints, and his sneaky-snakin' which could easily make for a good segment on _Hard Copy_.276: "Accessory" by Orion.  More real-life bad-business, in a first-personnarrative.  Drunks with guns, that sorta thing.277: "RUSH TO JUDGEMENT - Why the World Won't End in Septeber, 1994" by Omegaand Reid Fleming.  Another stupendously large file debunking religious hoo-haw.This one concerns a Mr. Harold Camping, President of Family Radio and author ofthe popular book, _Are You Ready?_ which attempts to explain why the SecondComing of Christ, the end of the world as we know it, etc. will occur inSeptember of 1994.  My money's on Omega and Reid Fleming.278: "Slowing" by Tom Fawcett.  Story about the time-compressing effects ofdepression.  Good moody atmosphere in this one.279: "Hammers" by Obscure Images.  The ultimate industrial music fantasy.280: "Caught in the Spotlight" by Peder Ast.  He's naked, he's running aroundoutside at night, and he's masturbating furiously.  Cool. __________________________________/cDc Gnuz\__________________________________Mail*Link( Remote             FWD>RE>Hellogore (Al Gore) writes:     Hi there.  I was just cruisin' along the information superhighway, when Icame across the number for The Works BBS in a Cult of the Dead Cow file.  Wow,those boys sure are raucous!  Tipper wouldn't approve.  I won't be bringingthose home to my sexy daughters, no way no how.     I am sure I can contribute, having an extensive knowledge of governmentrelated issues.  I want you hackers to know that I support free speech andfreedom of information, and will help in any way possible to further yourcause.  I could do it too, you know.  The vice president doesn't just sitaround all the time like people think he does.  I AM AL GORE!  Al Muthafuckin'Gore, and I am on your BBS.  I hope you realize the significance of this, andwill act accordingly.Al Gore                               --*--*--*--*--*--     You need my lovin', you need my huggin', baby, and you need my years ofpointless experience editing text files to an anal 't.'  Oh yeah.  Nothing canwork ProTERM on an Apple II like my gentle caress.  The Global DominationFactory Direct Outlet list isn't updated for this release 'cause I don't havetime.  There will be a October release though and I'll get to it by then.  I'llalways be here for you, you know that.  Currently, the best ftp and gopher sitefor cDc files on the Internet is ftp.eff.org in pub/publications/CuD/cdc.  Justlike that... it's so simple, it's beautiful.  The mirror sites aren't reallyall that mirrored as far as getting the newer stuff.  But you know, when I'msitting here all alone in my room on the beanbag on the floor and my Jesuscandle's throwing its flickers on the wall, all I can do is think about you andhow your eyes would glow in the candlelight.  I just want to hold you close andmake you understand that Lady Carolin is working on her commercial site whichwill have all the latest cDc releases as soon as they come out, lickety-split. She's just a friend... you're the one that makes me complete.  Come here, comecloser.  Let me whisper in your ear.  Drunkfux will be making an announcementon this year's HoHoCon soon.  I can't talk any more, it's too much.     Hold me.S.
