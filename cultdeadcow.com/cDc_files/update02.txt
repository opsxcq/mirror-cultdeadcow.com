This marks the end of the Metal Communications/NeonKnights BBS systems, which were very popular during the early to mid 1980's. There is a file, entitled "The End of the Metal AE" which is a buffer dump of acall to the AE during its last days.  The Metal AE will be missed._______________________________________________________________________________cDc Global Domination Update #2 - by S. Ratte' - "Hyperbole is our business"
