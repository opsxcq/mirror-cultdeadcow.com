On July 21, a self-described hacker group known as the Cult of the
Dead Cow released a tool called BackOrifice, and suggested that
Windows users were at risk from unauthorized attacks.

<td width=15>&nbsp;</td>

<td valign=top>
Actually, we released it on August 3rd.

Incidentally, it's been downloaded at least 35,000 times as of 11:55pm, August 7th.

This is simply false.  Our view is no degree of "safe computing practices"

in Windows&nbsp;95 &amp; 98.

According to its creators, BackOrifice is "a self-contained,
self-installing utility which allows the user to control and monitor 
computers running the Windows operating system over a network". The
authors claim that the program can be used to  remotely control a
Windows computer, read everything that the user types at the keyboard,
capture images that are  displayed on the monitor, upload and download
files remotely, and redirect information to a remote internet site.
</tt>
</td>

<td width=15>&nbsp;</td>

<td valign=top>
Back Orifice does not do anything that the Windows&nbsp;95/98 operating
system was not intended to do.  It does not take advantage of any bugs
in the operating system or use any undocumented or internal APIs.  It
uses documented calls built into Windows to do such things as:
<p>

<ul>
<li>Reveal all cached passwords.  This includes passwords for web
sites, dialup connections, network drives and printers, and the
passwords of any application that stores user passwords in the  
operating system.
(This Windows feature was implemented apparently so the user won't be 
inconvenienced by having to remember his
passwords every time he uses his computer.)
<p>

<li>Create shares hidden to the user and list the passwords of existing
shares.
<p>

<li>Make itself mostly invisible.  Back Orifice does not appear in the
control-alt-delete list of running programs, and can only be killed by
a low level process viewer which Windows&nbsp;95 does not ship with.  To
their credit, Windows&nbsp;98 does ship with a process viewer, but it is not
installed by default.

<td width=15>&nbsp;</td>

<td valign=top>
Back Orifice does <b>not</b> rely on the user for its installation.
To install it,
it simply needs to be run.  Thanks to some actual exploits, there are
several ways a program could be run on a windows computer, not only
without the user's approval, but without the user's knowledge.

...and, once installed, has only the rights and privileges that 
the user has on the computer.
</tt>
</td>

<td width=15>&nbsp;</td>

<td>
This is correct. Once installed, Back Orifice can only do what the user
sitting at the computer could do, if he has programs that do everything
that Back Orifice does.
<p>

This includes:
<ul>
<li>seeing what's on the screen
<li>seeing what's typed into the keyboard
<li>installing software
<li>uninstalling software
<li>rebooting the computer
<li>viewing stored passwords
<li>viewing and editing the system registry
<li>connecting and disconnecting the machine to other network hosts
using <b>anyone's</b> username &amp; password
<li>running arbitrary plugins or programs, which of course could
employ any manner of exploit or attack

<li>The user must deliberately install, or be tricked into installing the

<td width=15>&nbsp;</td>

<td valign=top>
<b>Not at all.</b>

Thanks to various security bugs and common system misconfigurations,
there are often ways
to deliver and execute arbitrary code on a Windows machine.
<p>

Even lacking such an exploit, it's easy enough to provide the average
Windows users a reason for downloading &amp; installing programs
from untrusted sources.  It happens all the time.

<td width=15>&nbsp;</td>

<b>Untrue.</b>

Back Orifice can sweep a range of IP addresses and network blocks
to hunt for installations
of its server software.

<td valign=top>
<tt>
<ul>
<li>The attacker must be able to directly address the user's
computer; e.g., there must not be a firewall between the attacker

<td width=15>&nbsp;</td>

<td valign=top>

<!-- And packets have to be able to get to and from the server. --> 
<b>Incorrect.</b>

The mere presence of a firewall or proxy server is not in itself a
complete solution.
<p>

For good, reliable protection for Windows machines on the internet, the cDc
can recommend nothing better than a good, <b>properly configured</b>
firewall.

However, a firewall that permits ANY traffic is still a potential risk.
<p>

Back Orifice can communicate over any available port. Therefore, if
the firewall lets through any UDP packets at all, two-way communication 
can be established.
<p>

As for file transfers originating at the remote machine, Back Orifice can
use TCP to send data out through the firewall.
<p>

Not to mention the hundreds of thousands of Windows&nbsp;95
and 98 boxes connected to the internet via a dialed connection through
their local or national isp.  For mass ip vendors like those, a
firewall simply isn't reasonable.  Most of the internet simply wouldn't
be accessible anymore.

BackOrifice is unlikely to pose a threat to the vast majority of
Windows&nbsp;95 or Windows&nbsp;98 users, especially those who follow safe
internet computing practices. Windows&nbsp;95 and Windows&nbsp;98 offer a set of
security features that will in general  allow users to safely use

BackOrifice must be installed  before it can run.

cDc remembers a day when PC software was written by anyone who had a
creative idea for a cute, useful, interesting, or even just plain
silly program and being able to share that program with friends who
might also enjoy the program.  It is unfortunate that the only software
we're allowed to run now is written by large companies.  It's a good
thing we can still trust them not to do something unwanted to our
computer!

Customers should keep their software up to date and should never
install or run software from unknown sources -- this applies to
both software available on the Internet and sent via e-mail. Reputable
software vendors digitally sign their software to verify its
authenticity and safety.   Companies should use the security
features provided by Microsoft products, to prevent the introduction of
this and other malicious software, and should monitor network
usage to prevent insider attacks.

Rather than having to abstain from using non-big company "Reputable
Vendor" software, how about providing some protection?
How about the ability to monitor and even prevent disk and registry
access so people can run software with confidence, so that even if the 
author has malicious intent, the software has become infected with an unknown 
virus or trojan, or there is a bug or malfunction, there is no damage it 
can do.

Incidentally, Microsoft is also falsely claiming that they
tried to contact us regarding BO.  On the contrary, Microsoft
has repeatedly shown little interest when contacted about security
holes in their products in the past.  In general, they have needed
to have their noses rubbed in it before acknowledging any problems.
<p>

cDc issued a preliminary press release about Back Orifice more than a 
month before releasing the software.  A wider-distribution Press
Release was issued on July 21st, more than a week before the
demonstration at DefCon VI... and again, nothing from Microsoft.
<p>

Other than issuing silly statements to the press, among other things calling 
us irresponsible and comparing BO to Satan (again, apples and oranges), 
they have never contacted us.  For over 3 days at Defcon, no one from
Microsoft introduced or identified themselves to us.  Immediately
following our presentation, we were swarmed by the media and the curious...
but no one from Microsoft.
<p>

It wasn't until August 4 that Scott Culp, Security Product Manager
for Windows&nbsp;NT Server contacted us in e-mail:
<p>

<blockquote>
<tt>
Date: Tue, 4 Aug 1998 11:41:53 -0700<br>
From: Scott Culp &lt;secure@microsoft.com&gt;<br>
To: "'veggie@cultdeadcow.com'" &lt;veggie@cultdeadcow.com&gt;<br>
Subject: BackOrifice<br>
<p>

I recently received report of your BackOrifice tool, and would welcome an
opportunity to talk with you about the tool and the security
vulnerabilities you believe it exploits.  Microsoft is interested in
making our products as secure as possible for our customers, and I'd look
forward to talking with you about this issue.
</tt>
</blockquote>
<p>

We immediately called him back.  He was interested in learning about
every vulnerability we knew of.  "The biggest one we know of is
Windows&nbsp;95/98 itself," to which he agreed.
<p>

Later that same day, Microsoft issued another statement -- this
time mentioning that they had tried to contact us and had gotten
no response.
<p>

The goliath doth protest too much, methinks.
<p>


The fact remains that Back Orifice is only as dangerous as Microsoft's 
security is deficient.
<p>

How about a for-instance?
<p>

Win95/98 caches frequently-used passwords in <b>clear-text</b>, which BO
has access to.  This often includes passwords users use for their ISPs.
But if one is to believe the missives which issue from the Microsoft
Marketing Department, ISPs have nothing to worry about.  Either that
or ISPs across the globe should encourage all their customers to
upgrade to NT?
<p>

Is Windows&nbsp;95/98 the platform on which you perform 'secure' transactions?
Is a Windows&nbsp;95/98 platform an endpoint of your corporate VPN?  If so,
maybe you should be worried.
<p>

Back Orifice is a Rorschach for Microsoft credibility. Microsoft's own 
official response to us was issued as a marketing bulletin!  Does anybody
else besides cDc find it disturbing that the Marketing Department is 
running the show over there? 
<p>

Oh, never mind.  Forget we ever mentioned it.  Listen to
Microsoft; don't worry, be happy.  Everything will be all right. 
<b>Move along, there's nothing to see here.</b>
