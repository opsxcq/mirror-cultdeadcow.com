<P>The Portable Executable file format, the format used for executables in such 
enviroments as OS/2 and Win32, is fairly well documented by Microsoft, but what 
isn't well documented is what the operating system does with the contents of the 
file when actually loading an executable. In this text I will refer to the part 
of the operating system that loads the executable as the PE loader or just 
simply the loader. PE files are not limited to .exe files, VxDs and DLLs are 
other types of PE files, but in this text I will be focusing on .exe files and 
.DLL files, which don't necessarily have to have those file extensions. The 
actual structures that apear in the files are defined in winnt.h and are used 
throughout this text. It is assumed that the reader is already familiar with the 
general structure of PE files. </P>
<P>When an executable (this includes DLLs) is loaded into memory, it is not 
simply copied into memory and executed, there are a number of steps the 
operating system takes to load the image correctly and set up things in that 
memory image before it jumps to the code in that image. After the individual 
sections in the PE file are copied to their approrpiate virtual memory 
locations, the loader uses the DataDirectory array in the IMAGE_OPTIONAL_HEADER 
of the executable to find the parts of the executable that need to be fixed 
before execution. The DataDirectory array is an array of 16 
IMAGE_DATA_DIRECTORY's, each of which has a predefined meaning:<BR><PRE>// Directory Entries

#define IMAGE_DIRECTORY_ENTRY_EXPORT          0   // Export Directory
#define IMAGE_DIRECTORY_ENTRY_IMPORT          1   // Import Directory
#define IMAGE_DIRECTORY_ENTRY_RESOURCE        2   // Resource Directory
#define IMAGE_DIRECTORY_ENTRY_EXCEPTION       3   // Exception Directory
#define IMAGE_DIRECTORY_ENTRY_SECURITY        4   // Security Directory
#define IMAGE_DIRECTORY_ENTRY_BASERELOC       5   // Base Relocation Table
#define IMAGE_DIRECTORY_ENTRY_DEBUG           6   // Debug Directory
#define IMAGE_DIRECTORY_ENTRY_ARCHITECTURE    7   // Architecture Specific Data
#define IMAGE_DIRECTORY_ENTRY_GLOBALPTR       8   // RVA of GP
#define IMAGE_DIRECTORY_ENTRY_TLS             9   // TLS Directory
#define IMAGE_DIRECTORY_ENTRY_LOAD_CONFIG    10   // Load Configuration Directory
#define IMAGE_DIRECTORY_ENTRY_BOUND_IMPORT   11   // Bound Import Directory in headers
#define IMAGE_DIRECTORY_ENTRY_IAT            12   // Import Address Table
#define IMAGE_DIRECTORY_ENTRY_DELAY_IMPORT   13   // Delay Load Import Descriptors
#define IMAGE_DIRECTORY_ENTRY_COM_DESCRIPTOR 14   // COM Runtime descriptor
</PRE>Although all of these entries are optional, most executables will contain 
one or more of them. For the entries that exist for a given executable, the 
system must perform operations to ensure that the memory will be in the expected 
state for the program to be able to function. Each entry requires different 
handling, not all of which I have figured out yet. 
<P></P>
<P>Import Directory<BR>The import directory contains the names of the DLLs that 
the executable is implicitly linked to, and the names or ordinals of the 
functions that are imported from those DLLs. The loader loads each DLL into the 
memory space for the new process and fills in the structures in the import 
directory of the executable (in memory) and fails to load the executable if it 
is unable to locate any DLL or function imported by the exe. If you wanted to 
handle the loading of these DLLs yourself, the code might look something 
like:<BR><PRE>HINSTANCE hInstance = GetModuleHandle(NULL);
PIMAGE_DOS_HEADER pdosheader = (PIMAGE_DOS_HEADER)hInstance;
PIMAGE_NT_HEADERS pntheaders = (PIMAGE_NT_HEADERS)((DWORD)hInstance + pdosheader-&gt;e_lfanew);
PIMAGE_SECTION_HEADER psectionheader = (PIMAGE_SECTION_HEADER)(pntheaders + 1);

{
	ptr = (PCHAR)((DWORD)hInstance+ pimportdescriptor-&gt;Name);
	handle = GetModuleHandle(ptr);
	if (handle == NULL)
		handle = LoadLibrary(ptr);
	if (handle == NULL)
        {
		wsprintf(buff, "A required .DLL file, %hs, was not found.", ptr);
		MessageBox(HWND_DESKTOP, buff, "Error Starting Program", MB_OK|MB_ICONEXCLAMATION);
		ExitProcess(0);
	}

	if (pimportdescriptor-&gt;TimeDateStamp != -1)
	{
		pimportdescriptor-&gt;ForwarderChain  = (DWORD)handle;
		pimportdescriptor-&gt;TimeDateStamp = 0xCDC31337;

		pthunkdataout = (PIMAGE_THUNK_DATA)((DWORD)hInstance + (DWORD)pimportdescriptor-&gt;FirstThunk);
		if (pimportdescriptor-&gt;Characteristics == 0)
			pthunkdatain = pthunkdataout;
		else 
			pthunkdatain = (PIMAGE_THUNK_DATA)((DWORD)hInstance + (DWORD)pimportdescriptor-&gt;Characteristics);

		while ( pthunkdatain-&gt;u1.AddressOfData != NULL)
		{
			if ((DWORD)pthunkdatain-&gt;u1.Ordinal &amp; IMAGE_ORDINAL_FLAG) // no name, just ordinal
			{
				dw = (DWORD)GetProcAddress(handle, MAKEINTRESOURCE(LOWORD(pthunkdatain-&gt;u1.Ordinal)));
			} else {
				pimportbyname = (PIMAGE_IMPORT_BY_NAME)((DWORD)pthunkdatain-&gt;u1.AddressOfData + (DWORD)hInstance);
				dw = (DWORD)GetProcAddress(handle, pimportbyname-&gt;Name);

				MessageBox(HWND_DESKTOP, buff, "Error Starting Program", MB_OK|MB_ICONEXCLAMATION);
				ExitProcess(0);
                                      
			}

			pthunkdataout-&gt;u1.Function = (PDWORD)dw;
        
			pthunkdatain++;
			pthunkdataout++;
		}
               
	} else { // -1 = new style bound import
		// don't know how to handle these yet...

	pimportdescriptor++;                
}

<P>Base Relocation Table<BR>Relocations, often called 'fixups', is an 
interesting issue. When an executable is linked, it contains imbedded in the 
code the addresses of where it expects it variables and functions to be. In 
Win32, the default base address that an executable (in this case, NOT including 
DLLs) is loaded to is 0x400000. DLLs load at a base address of 0x1000, so there 
is an issue when you try to load a second DLL into a process, the DLL will not 
be able to load at the address it expects. The loader adds the difference 
between where the executable expected to be loaded to and where it actually was 
loaded to to each address in the executable's memory so that they will again 
point to the correct area in memory. However, why would an executable need a 
fixup table, since only one executable can be loaded into a process space, it is 
loaded first, and the default base address should always be available. If this 
default base address were to change in the future (as it did between Win 3.x and 
Win32), then there might be cases when an executable couldn't be loaded to it's 
prefered address, but as of MS Visual C 5 and later linkers, they no longer 
produce relocation tables in executables. I guess Microsoft has decided they 
will never need to change the default base address. To do the fixups for an 
executable yourself, the code might look like:<BR><PRE>HINSTANCE hInstance = GetModuleHandle(NULL);
PIMAGE_DOS_HEADER pdosheader = (PIMAGE_DOS_HEADER)hInstance;
PIMAGE_NT_HEADERS pntheaders = (PIMAGE_NT_HEADERS)((DWORD)hInstance + pdosheader-&gt;e_lfanew);
PIMAGE_SECTION_HEADER psectionheader = (PIMAGE_SECTION_HEADER)(pntheaders + 1);
PIMAGE_BASE_RELOCATION pbaserelocation;
DWORD dw;
PWORD pw;
PDWORD pdw;
TCHAR buff[1024];
HANDLE handle;


if ((DWORD)hInstance != pntheaders-&gt;OptionalHeader.ImageBase &amp;&amp; pntheaders-&gt;OptionalHeader.DataDirectory[15].Size)
{
	pbaserelocation = (PIMAGE_BASE_RELOCATION)((DWORD)hInstance + pntheaders-&gt;OptionalHeader.DataDirectory[15].Size);
	while (pbaserelocation-&gt;VirtualAddress != 0)
	{
		pw = (PWORD)((DWORD)pbaserelocation + sizeof(IMAGE_BASE_RELOCATION));
		for (x = 0; x &lt; (pbaserelocation-&gt;SizeOfBlock-sizeof(IMAGE_BASE_RELOCATION))/2; x++)
		{
			pdw = (PDWORD)(pbaserelocation-&gt;VirtualAddress + (DWORD)hInstance + (*pw &amp; 0xFFF));
			switch(*pw &gt;&gt; 12)
			{
				case IMAGE_REL_BASED_ABSOLUTE:
				break;
				case IMAGE_REL_BASED_HIGHLOW:
					dw = *pdw;
					dw = dw - pntheaders-&gt;OptionalHeader.ImageBase + (DWORD)hInstance;
					if (dw &lt; (DWORD)hInstance || dw &gt; (DWORD)hInstance + pntheaders-&gt;OptionalHeader.SizeOfImage)
					{
						wsprintf(buff, "*pdw = 0x%08x", *pdw);
						MessageBox(HWND_DESKTOP, buff, "Bad pointer:", MB_OK );
					} else {
						*pdw = dw;
					}
				break;
				default:
				case IMAGE_REL_BASED_HIGH:
				case IMAGE_REL_BASED_LOW:
						// these are not used in Win32 exe's
					wsprintf(buff, "*pw = 0x%04x  *pdw = 0x%08x", *pw, *pdw);
					MessageBox(HWND_DESKTOP, buff, "Unexpected relocation type:", MB_OK);
				break;
			}

			pw++;
		}
		pbaserelocation = (PIMAGE_BASE_RELOCATION)((DWORD)pbaserelocation + pbaserelocation-&gt;SizeOfBlock);
	}                
}

<P>The above steps are enough for a basic executable created with the old style 
linkers. However, if an executable contains other directory entries, like 
resources for instance, other fixups may be necessary. Executables created with 
MSVC 5 and later need additional fixups that I have not identified. If you have 
any knowledge in this area, please share! </P>
<P>The above information is enough to create a 'PE wrapper', a program which 
modifies an executable so that it changes the directories in the original file, 
inserts it's own 'startup' code and handles all the loading normally handled by 
the operating system. Why would we want to do this? Because we can modify the 
data in the original sections of the executable, for instance compressing them 
to make a smaller executable or encrypting them to hide the contents of the 
original executable. The reasons for compressing an exe are obvious, but why 
would we want to encrypt the contents of an executable? There are several 
reasons, some with good intentions and many with bad. By encrypting an 
executable, the average user, even the average developer, can no longer identify 
the contents of an executable. The strings that are normally stored in plain 
text will be hidden, as well well as the dissasmblable code, will be hidden. The 
DLLs and functions implicitly imported by the exe will be hidden, all that will 
be visible are the functions imported by your startup loader code, probably 
user32.dll and kernel32.dll. </P>
<P>A side effect of changing the contents of the original executable is that any 
signatures in that executable will be hidden. Signature scanning is the standard 
method of anti-virus protection offered today. Every time an executable is about 
to be executed, the virus scanner scans the FILE image for the signatures of 
'bad code' that you don't want to run on your system. However, once the process 
has begun execution, it can load anything it wants into memory and execute it, 
including executable code that contains signatures of 'bad code' that you do not 
want to run on your system. So simply by compressing or encrypting an exe, you 
can make even a program as well known as Back Orifice invisible to virus 
scanners. There are already commercially availabe executable compressors which 
could serve this purpose, as well as free source programs which encrypt the 
contents of an executable with a simple bit rotation. Even that is enough to 
prevent signature scanners from detecting bad code. </P>
<H3>Get the program</H3>
<HR>

<P>There are two parts to PE Crunch: the compresser and the loader stub that 
gets inserted into the new executable. </P>
<P>NOTE: For this program to work correctly, assumptions are made about the 
format of the loader stub executable, specifically that the sections will be: 
Code, constants/data (unused), import data, relocations. I used Watcom 11 to 
create this project. Also note that the loader stub has no WinMain entry point, 
you should point the entry point to wstart_ function. You must also enable 
'inline intrinsic functions' so that no calls to the clib are made. See my file 
on <A href="../cDc_files/cDc-0398.html">creating small 
executables</A> for more on linking without the standard c library. </P>
<P>NOTE: This exe compressor only works on older style executables. It will NOT 
correctly compress executables created with the linker that comes with MSVC 5 or 
later. I am still trying to figure out what it is that they are doing 
differently. If you have any info that might help me, <A
