  DETAILED SPECIFICATIONS <A 
  href="http://www.faqs.org/rfcs/rfc1002.html">http://www.faqs.org/rfcs/rfc1002.html</A> 
  </LI></UL>
<H3>Background:</H3>
<P>Machines using the NetBIOS protocol over a TCP/IP network use UDP packets 
sent from and to UDP port 137 for name resolution and management. NetBIOS names 
consist of 15 uppercase characters followed by a one-byte value (the service 
value). Many <A href="nbname/nbsvcs.txt">service 
values</A> are used as NetBIOS networks to identify well-known services and 
other applications, but any application can register and use any name and value 
if that name isn't a unique name and already in use on the network. The NetBIOS 
service broadcasts a NAME REGISTRATION REQUEST to determine if a name is in use 
before it attempts to use it. If the name is already in use, the machine owning 
that name will DENY the name registration request, and the registration attempt 
will fail. Each NetBIOS node (machine or interface) on the network maintains a 
list of names that it owns and that node is responsible for defending any unique 
names that it owns by denying other nodes' name registration requests. If a 
NetBIOS node detects a name conflict it will mark the name in its local table as 
being in conflict. RFC 1001 has this to say about names in conflict: </P><PRE>     Logically, a marked name does not exist on that node.  This means 
   that the node should not defend the name (for name claim purposes), 
   should not respond to a name discovery requests for that name, nor 
   should the node send name refresh messages for that name. 
   Furthermore, it can no longer be used by that node for any session 
   establishment or sending or receiving datagrams.  Existing sessions 
   are not affected at the time a name is marked as being in conflict. 

   The only valid user function against a marked name is DELETE NAME. 
   Any other user NetBIOS function returns immediately with an error 
   code of "NAME CONFLICT". 
</PRE>
<H3>Issues:</H3>
<P>Machines which do not react as the NetBIOS protocol dictates can disable 
NetBIOS networks by causing the names in other NetBIOS name tables to become in 
conflict. By denying all name registration requests, NetBIOS nodes will always 
think that their names are already in use on the network. Windows machines 
display the message that the chosen machine name is already in use and direct 
the user to change the name and reboot. By sending a NetBIOS node NAME RELEASE 
REQUESTS for each name in its table, a machine will stop responding to name 
requests, not be able to create or receive any new NetBIOS connections or 
datagrams and become isolated from the NetBIOS network. </P>
<P>Because the protocol is entirely unauthenticated, any machine can respond to 
broadcast queries for any name it sees queries for, possibly even beating 
legitimate name holders to the response. The address of the responding node will 
be returned and whatever type of connection was attempting to be made will 
attempt to connect to that address instead. In fact, in ANY place in windows 
that is expecting a host name, even an internet address like www.crap.edu, if 
the system is unable to resolve the address via DNS it will attempt to resolve 
it via a broadcast NetBIOS name packet if it is 15 characters or less. So if 
someone on the network tried to connect to www.crap,edu (a common unnoticed 
typo, a comma instead of a period) after the DNS request failed it will 
broadcast a name query for WWW.CRAP,EDU. If fake services were set up, such as 
telnet, ftp or whatever, most users wouldn't notice the mistake until it were 
too late. </P>
<H3>External solution:</H3>
<P>Block UDP 137 on your firewall or router. If NetBIOS networking is not 
required, for God's sake uninstall it! </P>
<H3>Internal solution:</H3>
<P>Microsoft recommends using IPSec for UDP 137. </P>
<H3>Microsofts response:</H3>
<P>I first sent a copy of NBName.cpp along with an extensive description of the 
problems to secure@microsoft.com on June 20th. I have since learned that they 
were notified about similar and same issues some time in March. They were very 
responsive throughout the entire exchange, although their response throughout 
has basically been "Thanks for the info, we're just about to release a patch". 
</P>
<P>On July 28th Microsoft released <A 
href="http://www.microsoft.com/technet/security/bulletin/ms00-047.asp">this 
bulletin</A> which provides a patch for Windows 2000. As of August 15th, the 
Windows NT 4.0 patch info still reads: </P><PRE>Windows NT 4.0 Workstation, Server, and Server, Enterprise Edition: Patch to be released shortly. 
Windows NT 4.0 Server, Terminal Server Edition: Patch to be released shortly. 
</PRE>
<P>Apparently Microsoft is having trouble "packaging" their NT 4.0 patch. 
Interestingly, nowhere in the bulletin does it mention Windows 9x, even though 
it is just as affected as any other platform using the NetBIOS protocol over 
TCP/IP. I asked them why this was and their response was basically that anyone 
concerned with "security" wouldn't be running Windows 9x anyawy. I would LOVE to 
not have to run Windows 95 anymore, but I have several thousand dollars worth of 
hardware and software (MP3 player that uses a propriatery parallel interface, 
video capture cards that only have 9x drivers due to promised then abandoned 
DirectX support for NT 4, Lego Mindstorm, tons of games etc!) that ONLY work 
under 9x! Is this is a sign that Microsoft is preparing to abandon these 
platforms? They sure do like Win2000... </P>
<P>On August Second, there was this report: </P><PRE>Private Sector - (U) (CERT/CC, 2 August) The CERT/CC has issued Special
Communication SC-2000.65 - NetBIOS, NBName, and the Cult of the Dead Cow
(cDc).  As reported in yesterday’s NIPC Daily Report, a new tool
exploiting several NetBIOS vulnerabilities has been released by a member
of the cDc.  Source and binary has been posted to the Web site
www.securityfocus.com.  Microsoft had previously released MS00-047 to
help mitigate against the effects of being attacked via these
vulnerabilities and suffering denial of NetBIOS services.  The CERT/CC
has not received any reports of the tool being used at present to attack
sites, but given the nature of the exposure surrounding past cDc tool
releases, CERT/CC is preparing to publish some document to give people
more information about the nature and scope of future activity involving
NBName and exploitation of these vulnerabilities.
</PRE>
<P>On August 10th, <A href="http://www.cert.org/">CERT</A> published <A 
href="http://www.kb.cert.org/vuls/id/32650">this Vulnerability Note</A> 
which outlines the problem and basically reccomends to block the appropriate 
ports, and install the patches that Microsoft has yet to provide, although it 
does note: </P>
<P>
<H5>Note that no patch is being furnished for Win9x systems; Microsoft has 
publically stated it feels patching these systems to disable name conflict 
resolution would cause more problems than it would help prevent, especially in 
networks with large numbers of Win9x systems. </H5>

<A name=nbname>
<H3>NBNAME:</H3>
<P>Check <A href="nbname/nbname.cpp">the source</A> for 
current version and changes. 
<P>NBName decodes and displays all NetBIOS name packets it receives on UDP port 
137. Using the /DENY * command line option it will respond negatively to all 
NetBIOS name registration packets it receives. Using the /CONFLICT command line 
option it will send a name release request for each name that is not already in 
conflict to machines it receives an adapter status response from. The /QUERY * 
command line option causes a wildcard name query request to be broadcast at 
startup and each machine that responds to the name query is sent an adapter 
status request. The /ASTAT command line option causes an adapter status request 
to be sent to the specified IP address, which doesn't have to be on your local 
network. Using /QUERY * /CONFLICT /DENY * will disable your entire local NetBIOS 
network and prevent machines from rejoining it. </P>
<P>NBName is much more than just a NetBIOS DoS tool: </P><PRE>Usage: NBName  [/CONFLICT] [/REVERSE] [/NOLOCAL|/NOLOCALNET] [/ASTATBACK]

  /PROXYUSER and /PROXYPASS let you supply authentication info to the proxy
  /QUERY will cause a name query for Name to be broadcast
  /ASTAT will send an adapter status (astat) request to TargetIP
  /ASTATBACK will send astat requests to nodes that respond to queries
  /SWEEP will send adapter status requests to all IPs from StartIP to EndIP
  /SCAN will send adapter status requests to first IP listed in on each
     line of IPList
  /DELAY will pause for ms milliseconds between each packet sent durring a
     scan or sweep, default 100 ms (10 packets per second)
  /REVERSE will send an astat request in response to astat requests

  /TO causes NBName to exit if no packets are received for ms milliseconds
  /RETRY changes the number of times failed packets are resent from 3 to Trys
  /CONFLICT* will send name release packets for each name in the remote name
     table of machines who respond to adapter status requests
  /RESPOND* will respond to name queries for NameOrFile
  /RESPONDIP will return RespIP for queries responded to if /RESPOND is
     used with a name or wildcard.  Defaults to LocalIP
  /DENY* will cause the name(s) specified by NameOrFile to be denied if a
     node tries to register it (them)
  /ALLOW* will deny all names _except_ NameOrFile
     NameOrFile can be a single name, the path to a file containing a list of
     names or * for all names (/ALLOW * is not valid).. Names can include a
     service value by adding a backslash followed by the hex service value
 *  These options may be damaging to network stability, use with caution!
</PRE>
<P>Using /SWEEP or /SCAN you can spew packets to blocks or lists of IPs, those 
machines with NetBIOS name services running will respond with their adapter 
status (including the contents of their name table). Using /OUTSVC you can have 
discovered machines appended directly to an lmhosts file, and using /SPAWN as 
well, you can use a <A href="nbname/donete.bat">batch 
file</A> to run a program which gathers information from found NetBIOS servers 
or audits them for open shares, dumb passwords etc (NAT)... Adapter status 
request packets are 96 bytes, so using the /DELAY option you can tune NBName to 
send packets as fast as the available bandwidth allows. If you send packets too 
fast some of them will simply get lost and not reach their destination. The 
default delay is 100 milliseconds or 10 packets per second, or 960 bytes per 
second. a 128kb DSL or cablemodem connection can probably safely handle delays 
as low as 10 ms, or 100 packets, or about 10k/s. At this speed you could scan an 
entire class C (65k IPs) in about 11 minutes, having a NetBIOS auditor or other 
program spawned in parallel each time a server is found. </P>
<P>Listening on the default port 137 and using /REVERSE, when someone queries 
your machine for NetBIOS adapter status it will display the request and respond 
instead with a request for the querying machine's status. It is important to 
realize that Windows machines will generate such a request AUTOMATICALLY if an 
application on that computer calls gethostbyaddress() and is unable to resolve 
an IP address's name via DNS, it will send an adapter status request directly to 
the address attempting to retrieve the NetBIOS name... So just because a machine 
requested your adapter status does not necessarily mean that they are trying to 
hack you or running nbtstat.exe... this fact however can be quite useful in 
detecting IDS systems on Windows machines by listening for NBNAME packets and 
probing a machine from an IP address that does not resolve to a name via DNS, if 
there is an IDS which is configured to immediately resolve the names of 
attacking addresses, you will see an adapter status request after the DNS lookup 
fails. </P>
<P>One of the most common problems with WANs is locating the NetBIOS machines 
that you can not send broadcast packets to (nodes on the far end of the WAN) if 
there is not a WINS server in use. Microsoft's sollution is to add the machines 
on the far end of the WAN to your lmhosts file which will be used to resolve a 
name to its address before a broadcast query is broadcast, but this is a pain 
for any large sized network, especially if IPs change at all. Using /OUTSVC in 
combination with /SCAN or /SWEEP you can quickly and easily create an lmhosts 
file. </P>
<H3>Extended descriptions of some options:</H3>
<H4>/PORT</H4>
<P>In order to receive the normal broadcast traffic that NetBIOS nodes generate 
you must be listening on the default port, 137. In Unix and Windows NT or 2000 
boxes you may have to run NBName as root or Administrator. Also see the notes 
for additional problems with binding. </P>
<H4>/DESTPORT</H4>
<P>Use this option to send packets to a port other than UDP 137. There are very 
few circumstances in which this will be a useful option. </P>
<H4>/PROXYIP /PROXYPORT /PROXYUSER and /PROXYPASS</H4>
<P>To route the UDP trafic through a SOCKS 5 proxy, you can use these options to 
specify the IP address of the proxy. All the other proxy options are optional. 
Currently only plaintext authentication is supported. </P>
<H4>/QUERY</H4>
<P>This options causes a name query for the name provided to be broadcast. This 
can be used to resolve a name to its owners address. /QUERY * will return cause 
all the workstations to be resolved. </P>
<H4>/ASTATBACK</H4>
<P>This option will cause adapter status requests to be sent to any machine that 
responds to a name query. Used in combination with /QUERY * this will cause an 
adapter status request to be sent to every machine on the local network. Used in 
combination with /QUERY * and /CONFLICT this will dissable every machine on the 
local network that responds to the broadcast query. </P>
<H4>/SWEEP</H4>
<P>This option causes an adapter status request to be sent to a block of IPs. 
You specify the starting address and the ending address, which need not be in 
the same class C block. Using /DELAY you can control the speed at which these 
packets are sent. </P>
<H4>/SCAN</H4>
<P>This option causes NBName to send adapter status requests to each of the IP 
addresses listed in the file supplied. It will read the IP address from the 
beginning of each line and ignore the rest, which means you can suply the files 
created by /OUTSRVS or /OUTALL. You can use /DELAY to control the speed at which 
packets are sent. </P>
<H4>/REVERSE</H4>
<P>When an adapter status request is received by NBName when this option is 
used, instead of that system responding with its adapter statys, NBName will 
send an adapter status back to port 137 on the machine that requested it. Using 
this in combination with /ASOUT you can log the name table, IP and mac address 
of people who request your adapter status. Using with /CONFLICT you can disable 
the NetBIOS networking of anyone who requests your adapter status if they have 
NetBIOS services running. Using it in combination with /SPAWN you can execute a 
script or program that does something else when someone requests your adapter 
status and has the server service running. It is probably a good idea to use 
/NOLOCALNET and definately /NOLOCAL with this command. </P>
<H4>/OUTSVC</H4>
<P>This options cause NBName to append machines with the <A 
href="nbname/nbsvcs.txt">service value</A> supplied to 
a file with their IP address followed by the NetBIOS name associated with this 
value, which is the same format as used by lmhosts files in both Unix (by Samba) 
and Windows. In Win9x this file is located in the system32 directory, in NT and 
2k it is in %windir%\system32\drivers\etc. NBName will always append to these 
files, but will not check if a machine with that IP or machine name already 
exists. If you want to use NBName to spawn a program that accesses the machine 
by its name and you are bound to the default port you will have to use one of 
these options to update the system lmhosts file. You will not be able to use 
\\123.321.123.432 to access the machine because Windows actually sends an 
adapter status request to the machine to get its machine name automagically for 
you and if NBName is listening on port 137 the system will not be able to 
retrieve the machine name. </P>
<H4>/SPAWN</H4>
<P>This option can be used to spawn another script or program when a machine 
with the <A href="nbname/nbsvcs.txt">service value</A> 
supplied responds to an adapter status request. You must suply at least one 
"argument" or paramater to pass to the program although the program or script 
obviously doesn't have to use it. The second paramater passed to the script or 
program is the IP address of the responding machine, and the third is the 
NetBIOS name the server is using. The program is spawned is parallel and NBName 
continues to run. </P>
<H4>/NOLOCAL and /NOLOCALNET</H4>
<P>If you are working with remote machines it is probably a good idea to use the 
/NOLOCALNET option. Machines on your "local network" are determined using the 
netmask, which can be provided using /NETMASK. /NOLOCAL will cause packets 
generated from the IP NBName is listening on to be ignored and not processed. 
</P>
<H4>/CONFLICT</H4>
<P>When a NetBIOS node receives a name release packet (which is basically saying 
"OK I'm done using this name") for a name that it has registered, it marks that 
name as being in conflict and stops using it. When an adapter status response is 
received by NBName and this option is used, it will send a name release packet 
for each name that is not already in conflict to that node, essentially 
disabling the NetBIOS networking on that node. The machine will probably have to 
be rebooted to operate properly again. </P>
<H4>/RESPOND</H4>
<P>This option allows you to answer to received name queries. You can respond to 
all names using * or a specific list of names by a name or filename containing 
the list. This will cause your IP address, or the IP address specified with 
/RESPONDIP, to be returned when someone on your network attempts to use a 
machine name that doesn't resolve via DNS (this will happen to non-NetBIOS 
related applications also as the system automatically tries to resolve names by 
hosts then lmhosts then DNS then WINS) and that machine will in turn probably 
try to connect to the returned address instead of whatever address the other 
machine was trying to connect to. It may also be able to respond faster than the 
node that actually owns the name if it is an actual name that is in use. If a 
filename is provided it can either be a straight list of names to be responded 
to with RespIP or LocalIP or it can be an lmhosts style file, IP address then 
name on each line. </P>
<H4>/ALLOW and /DENY</H4>
<P>These options let you deny name registration requests so that NetBIOS nodes 
will think that their machine name is already in use on the network and not be 
able to function. You can deny all names using /DENY * or suply a specific name 
or list of names to deny, or you can deny all names except a specific name or 
list of names using /ALLOW. </P>
<H3>Notes:</H3>
<P>NBName should compile on Win32 and Unix platforms, but will not be able to 
run on Win2k if NetBIOS is already bound to the IP interface being used. This is 
because Microsoft created a new socket flag which prevents other applications 
from re-binding in front of the socket. This flag was implemented in NT 4.0 SP4 
but apparently not used except in Win2k. </P>
<P>While you can bind to any port using the /PORT command (except as noted 
above), old Win95 boxes (pre-OSR2) will always respond to UDP 137. This means 
that unless you use the default port you will not see the responses from those 
machines. However, this method can also be used to locate pre-osr2 win95 
machines which may be vulnerable to a few known exploits. </P>
<P>Many Unix platforms seem to have issues receiving broadcast UDP packets. This 
may prevent the many options from working as NBName will not be able to receive 
the normal NetBIOS traffic, options like /ALLOW /DENY /RESPOND.. Obviously you 
must be listening on the default port (137) for these options to work. </P>
<P>On my NT box after binding in front of the system to UDP 137 I have 
repeatedly seen it bind without error but then never receive the packets 
destined for that port. It seems to fix itself most of the time. Using the /PORT 
option you can bind to other ports (which may also allow you to get UDP packets 
through a firewall by binding to a "trusted" port such as 53) and MOST Windows 
machines will respond to that port, but some old Win95 boxes will always respond 
to UDP 137 no matter the source port. </P>
<P>There may be some issues related to the end node types which may cause NBName 
to function improperly on networks that do not use B-nodes. </P>
<P>Using /REVERSE without /NOLOCAL(NET) may cause NBName to send packets to 
itself as fast as it can. That would be a bad thing. </P>
<P>Names, either supplied with the option or in the filename, can include a <A 
href="nbname/nbsvcs.txt">service value</A> by appending 
a backslash (\) followed by the hex service value (such as SERVER\20). If no 
service value is supplied, 00 is used (workstation service). The most commonly 
used service values are 00 (workstation) and 20 (server). </P>
<P>Names with spaces in them can be specified on the command line by putting 
quotes around the name, such as NBName /QUERY "THE NAME" ...and may even include 
a service value like NBName /DENY "THE NAME\20" </P>
