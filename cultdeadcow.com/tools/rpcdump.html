<P>A commonly overlooked area of security is Remote Procedure Call, possibly 
because most people don't understand anything about it. RPCDUMP is a program 
which provides console access to the RPC APIs in Windows. To use it, some base 
understanding of the different pieces necessary to create an RPC connection is 
required. Microsoft provides plenty of information about RPC. </P><PRE>c:\&gt;rpcdump -?

Identification - The server has information about client but cannot impersonate
Impersonation  - The server is the client on the client’s behalf
Values for type:
Dynamic - A pointer to the security token is maintained.
Static  - Security settings associated with the endpoint represent a copy 
         of the security information at the time the endpoint was created.
         The settings do not change. 
Values for bool:
True  - Effective = TRUE; only Windows NT security settings set to ON are
        included in the token. 
False - Effective = FALSE; all Windows NT security settings, including those
        set to OFF, are included in the token.

<P>The minimum info necessary to perform something like ENUM (enumerate remote 
endpoints) is a network address, the format of which depends on the protocol you 
are using. The default protocol is ncacn_ip_tcp, a tcp connection to a port 
(default 135), the address of which would be the machine name or ip address. 
Your rpc system may support even more protocols than are listed in the help. 
</P>
<P>The information produced by rpcdump may or may not actually be useful. One 
thing missing is the ability to actually connect to the endpoints and exchange 
data. Doing this usually requires knowing all the information about the endpoint 
at compile time, and I'm looking at ways to do this dynamically. However, just 
with the functionality included, many servers (especially web servers on the 
internet) dump a ton of information, often including all the virtual IPs that 
server is handling. </P>

<P>Here is some more information about the specific pieces that make up an rpc 
connection. Much of this text is copyrighted by <A 
href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/">Microsoft</A>: </P><PRE>Protocol Sequence

Specifies a character string that represents a valid combination of an RPC protocol (such as "ncacn"), 
a transport protocol (such as "tcp"), and a network protocol (such as "ip"). 
Microsoft RPC supports the following protocol sequences:

Protocol sequence		Description				Supporting Platforms
ncacn_nb_tcp		Connection-oriented NetBIOS over TCP		client only: MS-DOS, Windows 3.x
									client and server: Windows NT
ncacn_nb_ipx		Connection-oriented NetBIOS over IPX		client only: MS-DOS, Windows 3.x
									client and server: Windows NT
ncacn_nb_nb		Connection-oriented NetBEUI			client only: MS-DOS, Windows 3.x
									client and server: Windows NT, Windows 95
ncacn_ip_tcp		Connection-oriented TCP/IP			client only: MS-DOS,Windows 3.x, and Apple Macintosh
									client and server: Windows 95 and Windows NT
ncacn_np		Connection-oriented named pipes			client only: MS-DOS, Windows 3.x, Windows 95
									client and server: Windows NT
ncacn_spx		Connection-oriented SPX				client only: MS-DOS, Windows 3.x
									client and server: Windows NT, Windows 95
ncacn_dnet_nsp		Connection-oriented DECnet transport		client only: MS-DOS, Windows 3.x
ncacn_at_dsp		AppleTalk DSP					client: Apple Macintosh
									server: Windows NT
ncacn_vns_spp		Connection-oriented Vines SPP transport		client only: MS-DOS, Windows 3.x
									client and server: Windows NT
ncadg_ip_udp		Datagram (connectionless) UDP/IP		client only: MS-DOS, Windows 3.x
									client and server: Windows NT
ncadg_ipx		Datagram (connectionless) IPX			client only: MS-DOS, Windows 3.x
									client and server: Windows NT
ncalrpc			Local procedure call				client and server: Windows NT and Windows 95

NetworkAddress

Specifies the network address of the system to receive remote procedure calls. 
The format and content of the network address depend on the specified protocol sequence as follows:

Protocol sequence	Network address					Examples
ncacn_nb_tcp		Windows NT machine name				myserver
ncacn_nb_ipx		Windows NT machine name				myserver
ncacn_nb_nb		Windows NT or Windows 95 machine name		myserver
ncacn_ip_tcp		four-octet internet address, or host name	128.10.2.30
									anynode.microsoft.com
ncacn_np		Windows NT server name 				\\myotherserver
			(leading double backslashes are optional)	myserver 
ncacn_spx		IPX internet address, or Windows NT server name	~0000000108002B30612C
									myserver	
ncacn_dnet_nsp 		Area and node syntax				4.120
ncacn_at_dsp		Windows NT machine name, optionally followed by servername@zonename
			@ and the AppleTalk zone name. Defaults to @*, 	servername
			the client’s zone, if no zone provided										
ncacn_vns_spp		StreetTalk server name of the form 		printserver@sdkdocs@microsoft
			item@group@organization	
ncadg_ip_udp		four-octet internet address, or host name	128.10.2.30
									anynode.microsoft.com
ncadg_ipx		IPX internet address, or Windows NT server name	~0000000108002B30612C
									myserver
ncalrpc			Machine name 					thismachine

The network-address field is optional. When you do not specify a network address, 
the string binding refers to your local host. It is possible to specify the name of 
the local machine when you use the ncalrpc protocol sequence, however doing so is 
completely unnecessary.

Endpoint

Specifies the endpoint, or address, of the process to receive remote procedure calls. 
An endpoint can be preceded by the keyword endpoint=. Specifying the endpoint is optional 
if the server has registered its bindings with the endpoint mapper. See RpcEpRegister.
The format and content of an endpoint depend on the specified protocol sequence as shown 
in the Endpoint/Option Table, below.

Option

Specifies protocol-specific options.. The option field is not required. Each option is specified 
by a {name, value} pair that uses the syntax option name=option value. Options are defined for 
each protocol sequence as shown in the Endpoint/Option Table, below.

Protocol sequence	Endpoint			Examples		Option name
ncacn_nb_tcp		Integer between 0 and 255. 	100			None
			Many values between 0 and 32 
			are reserved by Microsoft.	
ncacn_nb_ipx		(as above)			(as above)		None
ncacn_nb_nb		(as above)			(as above)		None
ncacn_ip_tcp		Internet port number		1025			None
ncacn_np		Windows NT named pipe. 		\\pipe\\pipename	Security 
			Name must start with "\\pipe".				(NT only)
ncacn_spx		Integer between 1 and 65535.	5000			None
ncacn_dnet_nsp		DECnet phase IV object number 	mailserver		None
			(must be preceded by the # 	#17	
			character), or object name	
ncacn_at_dsp		A character string, 		myservicesendpoint	None
			up to 22 bytes long 	
ncacn_vns_spp		Vines SPP port number 		500			None
			between 250 and 511
ncadg_ip_udp		Internet port number		1025			Security (32-bit only)
ncadg_ipx		Integer between 1 and 65535.	5000			Security (32-bit only)
ncalrpc			String specifying application 	my_printer		Security 
			or service name. The string 				(NT only)
			cannot include any backslash 
			characters.	

The Security option name, supported for the ncalrpc, ncacn_np, ncadg_ip_udp, and ncadg_ipx protocol sequences, takes the following option values:

Option name	Option value
Security	{identification | anonymous | impersonation} {dynamic | static} {true | false}
If the Security option name is specified, one entry from each of the sets of Security option values must also be supplied. The option values must be separated by a single-space character. For example, the following Option fields are valid:

Security=identification dynamic true
Security=impersonation static true
 

The Security option values have the following meanings:

Security option value	Description
Anonymous		The client is anonymous to the server.
Dynamic			A pointer to the security token is maintained. Security settings represent 
			current settings and include changes made after the endpoint was created.
False			Effective = FALSE; all Windows NT security settings, including those set 
			to OFF, are included in the token.
Identification		The server has information about client but cannot impersonate.
Impersonation		The server is the client on the client’s behalf.
Static			Security settings associated with the endpoint represent a copy of the security 
			information at the time the endpoint was created. The settings do not change. 
True			Effective = TRUE; only Windows NT security settings set to ON are included 
			in the token. 

For more information about Microsoft Windows NT security options, 
see your Microsoft Windows NT programming documentation.

Remarks

The string binding is an unsigned character string composed of strings that represent the 
binding object UUID, the RPC protocol sequence, the network address, and the endpoint and 
endpoint options. White space is not allowed in string bindings except where required by 
the Option syntax. 

Default settings for the NetworkAddress, Endpoint, and Option fields vary according to 
the value of the ProtocolSequence field.

For all string-binding fields, a single backslash character (\) is interpreted as an 
escape character. To specify a single literal backslash character, you must supply two 
backslash characters (\\).

The following are examples of valid string bindings. In these examples, obj-uuid is 
used for convenience to represent a valid UUID in string form. Instead of showing 
the UUID 308FB580-1EB2-11CA-923B-08002B1075A7, the examples show obj-uuid.

obj-uuid@ncacn_ip_tcp:16.20.16.27[2001]
obj-uuid@ncacn_ip_tcp:16.20.16.27[endpoint=2001]

A string binding contains the character representation of a binding handle and sometimes 
portions of a binding handle. String bindings are convenient for representing portions 
of a binding handle, but they can’t be used for making remote procedure calls. They must 
first be converted to a binding handle by calling the RpcBindingFromStringBinding routine.

Additionally, a string binding does not contain all of the information from a binding 
handle. For example, the authentication information, if any, associated with a binding 
handle is not translated into the string binding returned by calling the 
RpcBindingToStringBinding routine.

During the development of a distributed application, servers can communicate their 
binding information to clients using string bindings to establish a client-server 
relationship without using the endpoint-map database or name-service database. To 
establish such a relationship, use the function RpcBindingToStringBinding to convert 
one or more binding handles from a binding-handle vector to a string binding, and 
provide the string binding to the client.
