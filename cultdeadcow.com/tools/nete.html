<P>The Netbios networking APIs under Windows 9x and NT are a mess. To start 
with, many of them are not implemented under 9x. Although you may be able to 
link your program without problem, many of the APIs return 120 
ERROR_CALL_NOT_IMPLEMENTED:This function is not supported on this system. More 
frustrating is that many of the APIs that are implemented return pointers to 
different types of structures on 9x and NT. Much of the documentation around 
these APIs is either misleading, flat out wrong, or missing. Many of the APIs 
are listed as being obsolete while no replacement for their functionality has 
been provided, yet several programs that come with windows like NetWatch.exe, 
and Net.exe, and NBTstat.exe clearly use these APIs which supposedly are only 
available for lazy programmers who don't want to rewrite their apps for the 
win32 API spec. Under NT most of the Net* functions are declared as accepting 
character pointers but in fact they want Unicode strings. The same is true for 
many of the structures returned, their members are declared as being pointers to 
character strings when in fact they are unicode strings. Some of the APIs are 
just plain misdeclared. </P>
<P>For any of these APIs to work on a remote target machine, that machine must 
have the Netbios protocol installed and bound to the adapter which you are 
communicating on. Most of the Net*Enum APIs require that the server service be 
running, and many others rely on specific other services (like the messenger 
service) to be able to retrieve data. All of these programs may only run under 
NT. There is also a registry entry which can be set to further restrict what 
information can be retrieved anonymously. </P>
<H3>Netbios()</H3>
<P>NBTstat.exe uses the Netbios() API to (among other things) send Netbios NAME 
packets on udp port 137 to an IP address to retrieve the remote adapter status 
of a Netbios interface. It also retrieves the names in the remote name table, 
which applications have registered as listening on. Netbios names are 15 
characters followed by a 16th binary value, and each names is registered as 
being either unique or a group name. Many names are standardly registered by 
specific apps, and by viewing the remote name list you can find out information 
about what software and services are running on the computer, configuration 
information such as the machine name, domain name and the name of the currently 
logged in user. Also returned by the Netbios adapter status call is the MAC 
address of the remote network adapter. If the "adapter" is actually a modem or 
other type of dialup access, the address will be listed as 44-45-53-54-00-00 
which in ascii spells out "DEST". If the adapter is a NIC, the MAC address is 
the manufacturer assigned globally unique ID. Apparently NIC manufacturers have 
started providing software with the hardware that allows you to change this ID 
arbitrarily. For more information how what this program may be useful for check 
the Microsoft documentation on the Netbios() API. </P>NetB.exe is a tool I have 
written which is basically a commandline wrapper around the Netbios() API. It's 
most useful command is ASTAT which retrieves the remote adapter status. Although 
most of the information returned in this structure is left empty, there is still 
a good deal of information available. In cases where no names are registered it 
will still display the MAC address unlike NBTStat.exe which simply returns "Host 
not found." Another problem with NBTstat.exe is that it uses some faulty logic 
to decide what adapter to send the packets on, so if you have more than one 
adapter (for instance a network card and a dialup connection) it will not 
function properly. You must select the correct adapter number to use with 
NetB.exe using the /A option. The adapter numbers correspond to the Lana Number 
values in Control Panel-Network-Services-Netbios Interface-Properties.

netb [Arguments] <COMMAND> [localname] [remotename]
 Arguments:
  /A AdapterNum   - Use adapter number AdapterNum (def 0)
  /G              - Local name is a group name
  /S              - SMB Relay mode
  /P              - Pause before exit (holds added name till exit)
  /W WaitMS       - Wait WaitMS milleseconds after EOF for final reads
  /?              - This help
 Command:
  ADDNAME         - Add a name to the local name table
  ASTAT           - Adapter status
  DGRECV          - Receive a datagram
  DGRECVBC        - Receive a broadcast datagram
  DGSEND          - Send a datagram
  DGSENDBC        - Send a broadcast datagram
  ENUM*           - Enumerate LAN adapters
  FINDNAME        - Find a name on the network
  LISTEN          - Listens for connections
  CALL            - Connect to a remote NetBIOS name
     (* NT Only)
 Note: Machine names are either a &lt; 16 char netbios name or an IP address.
       The binary 16th char can be set by adding \xx to the end of the name
       where xx is the hex value.  Default is 0. * is a special wildcard name.
</PRE>
<P>When using the LISTEN or CALL commands, NetB supports input from either the 
console or a file via redirection. When using console input, entering of the 
data to send begins when you begin typing, and the data is sent when a CR is 
entered. NetB will exit when a CONTROL-Z is entered on a line of its own. When 
using file input, the /S option can be used to have data sent in SMB packets if 
the input file is formatted properly. It will send each packet and wait for a 
response. If used with the LISTEN command, it will first wait for a packet from 
the client and send responses. </P>

<H3>Net*Enum() APIs and NULL sessions</H3>
<P>Many of the Net* APIs are documented as having been replaced by WNet* 
functions, yet many of them accomplish things which can not be done with their 
corresponding WNet function. Furthermore, there are many documentation errors 
relating to these functions about what security access is required to call the 
APIs at what levels, and Windows has had several bugs found (mostly pre SP3) 
relating to what information levels can be returned to anonymous remote users. 
Although you can not do "net view" on an NT or 2k machine normally, if you first 
connect with a NULL session (username NULL and password NULL) the remote machine 
treats you as an anonymous browser. To connect with a NULL session from the 
commandline in NT use: </P><PRE>net use /user:"" \\MachineNameOrIP ""
</PRE>
<P>Now not only can you do a "net view" you can execute a number of APIs which 
return information about the remote machine: 
<P><PRE>GetServerInfo() - displays info about the remote machine including OS type, comment, and flags
NetWkstaGetInfo() - displays info about remote machine including name and domains
NetWkstaUserEnum() - displays the users logged into the remote machine
NetShareEnum()  - displays hidden shares as well (shares ending in $)
NetUserEnum()   - displays users including their Full name, description, type etc
NetRemoteTOD()  - displays the remote clock and uptime
NetTransportEnum() - displays remote information for NICs bound to NETBIOS including MAC addresses
NetEnumerateTrustedDomains() - displays other domains that are trusted by the target machine's
NetServerTransportEnum() - displays the name and MAC address of the adapters Netbios is bound to
NetLocalGroupEnum() - displays remote local groups, their description and their members
NetGroupEnum()  - displays remote global groups and their members
NetServerEnum() - displays machines in the remote browse list (visible Netbios machines)
NetSessionEnum()- displays user and machine name for connections to remote server
</PRE>
<P>There are also many other APIs which may require more access than a NULL 
session. NetE.exe is a utility I have written which calls one or more of the 
APIs that return remote information at each of their valid levels until data is 
retrieved. NetE returns a LOT of information, so to see it I reccomend either 
redirecting the output to a file or making your console window very large (I 
typically do "mode 80,5000" so I have a scroll back buffer for the command 
prompt). For machines with lots of users or shares, there may be long pauses 
while the data is transfered, especially if that data is being transfered across 
a slow network connection (like the internet). </P>
